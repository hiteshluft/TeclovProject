    "A lot has been said during the past several years about how precision medicine and, more concretely, how genetic testing is going to disrupt the way diseases like cancer are treated.\n",

But the challenge is distinguishing the mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passengers). \n",

       "      <td>Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) regulate a variety of fundamental cellular processes. CDK10 stands out as one of the last orphan CDKs for which no activating cyclin has been identified and no kinase activity revealed. Previous work has shown that CDK10 silencing increases ETS2 (v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 2)-driven activation of the MAPK pathway, which confers tamoxifen resistance to breast cancer cells. The precise mechanisms by which CDK10 modulates ETS2 activity, and more generally the functions of CDK10, remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that CDK10 is a cyclin-dependent kinase by identifying cyclin M as an activating cyclin. Cyclin M, an orphan cyclin, is the product of FAM58A, whose mutations cause STAR syndrome, a human developmental anomaly whose features include toe syndactyly, telecanthus, and anogenital and renal malformations. We show that STAR syndrome-associated cyclin M mutants are unable to interact with CDK10. Cyclin M silencing phenocopies CDK10 silencing in increasing c-Raf and in conferring tamoxifen resistance to breast cancer cells. CDK10/cyclin M phosphorylates ETS2 in vitro, and in cells it positively controls ETS2 degradation by the proteasome. ETS2 protein levels are increased in cells derived from a STAR patient, and this increase is attributable to decreased cyclin M levels. Altogether, our results reveal an additional regulatory mechanism for ETS2, which plays key roles in cancer and development. They also shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying STAR syndrome.Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play a pivotal role in the control of a number of fundamental cellular processes (1). The human genome contains 21 genes encoding proteins that can be considered as members of the CDK family owing to their sequence similarity with bona fide CDKs, those known to be activated by cyclins (2). Although discovered almost 20 y ago (3, 4), CDK10 remains one of the two CDKs without an identified cyclin partner. This knowledge gap has largely impeded the exploration of its biological functions. CDK10 can act as a positive cell cycle regulator in some cells (5, 6) or as a tumor suppressor in others (7, 8). CDK10 interacts with the ETS2 (v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 2) transcription factor and inhibits its transcriptional activity through an unknown mechanism (9). CDK10 knockdown derepresses ETS2, which increases the expression of the c-Raf protein kinase, activates the MAPK pathway, and induces resistance of MCF7 cells to tamoxifen (6).Here, we deorphanize CDK10 by identifying cyclin M, the product of FAM58A, as a binding partner. Mutations in this gene that predict absence or truncation of cyclin M are associated with STAR syndrome, whose features include toe syndactyly, telecanthus, and anogenital and renal malformations in heterozygous females (10). However, both the functions of cyclin M and the pathogenesis of STAR syndrome remain unknown. We show that a recombinant CDK10/cyclin M heterodimer is an active protein kinase that phosphorylates ETS2 in vitro. Cyclin M silencing phenocopies CDK10 silencing in increasing c-Raf and phospho-ERK expression levels and in inducing tamoxifen resistance in estrogen receptor (ER)+ breast cancer cells. We show that CDK10/cyclin M positively controls ETS2 degradation by the proteasome, through the phosphorylation of two neighboring serines. Finally, we detect an increased ETS2 expression level in cells derived from a STAR patient, and we demonstrate that it is attributable to the decreased cyclin M expression level observed in these cells.Previous SectionNext SectionResultsA yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen unveiled an interaction signal between CDK10 and a mouse protein whose C-terminal half presents a strong sequence homology with the human FAM58A gene product [whose proposed name is cyclin M (11)]. We thus performed Y2H mating assays to determine whether human CDK10 interacts with human cyclin M (Fig. 1 Aâ€“C). The longest CDK10 isoform (P1) expressed as a bait protein produced a strong interaction phenotype with full-length cyclin M (expressed as a prey protein) but no detectable phenotype with cyclin D1, p21 (CIP1), and Cdi1 (KAP), which are known binding partners of other CDKs (Fig. 1B). CDK1 and CDK3 also produced Y2H signals with cyclin M, albeit notably weaker than that observed with CDK10 (Fig. 1B). An interaction phenotype was also observed between full-length cyclin M and CDK10 proteins expressed as bait and prey, respectively (Fig. S1A). We then tested different isoforms of CDK10 and cyclin M originating from alternative gene splicing, and two truncated cyclin M proteins corresponding to the hypothetical products of two mutated FAM58A genes found in STAR syndrome patients (10). None of these shorter isoforms produced interaction phenotypes (Fig. 1 A and C and Fig. S1A).Fig. 1.In a new window Download PPTFig. 1.CDK10 and cyclin M form an interaction complex. (A) Schematic representation of the different protein isoforms analyzed by Y2H assays. Amino acid numbers are indicated. Black boxes indicate internal deletions. The red box indicates a differing amino acid sequence compared with CDK10 P1. (B) Y2H assay between a set of CDK proteins expressed as baits (in fusion to the LexA DNA binding domain) and CDK interacting proteins expressed as preys (in fusion to the B42 transcriptional activator). pEG202 and pJG4-5 are the empty bait and prey plasmids expressing LexA and B42, respectively. lacZ was used as a reporter gene, and blue yeast are indicative of a Y2H interaction phenotype. (C) Y2H assay between the different CDK10 and cyclin M isoforms. The amino-terminal region of ETS2, known to interact with CDK10 (9), was also assayed. (D) Western blot analysis of Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) and CycM-V5-6His expression levels in transfected HEK293 cells. (E) Western blot analysis of Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) immunoprecipitates obtained using the anti-Myc antibody. â€œInputsâ€� correspond to 10 Î¼g total lysates obtained from HEK293 cells coexpressing Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) and CycM-V5-6His. (F) Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitates obtained using the anti-CDK10 antibody or a control goat antibody, from human breast cancer MCF7 cells. â€œInputâ€� corresponds to 30 Î¼g MCF7 total cell lysates. The lower band of the doublet observed on the upper panel comigrates with the exogenously expressed untagged CDK10 and thus corresponds to endogenous CDK10. The upper band of the doublet corresponds to a nonspecific signal, as demonstrated by it insensitivity to either overexpression of CDK10 (as seen on the left lane) or silencing of CDK10 (Fig. S2B). Another experiment with a longer gel migration is shown in Fig. S1D.Next we examined the ability of CDK10 and cyclin M to interact when expressed in human cells (Fig. 1 D and E). We tested wild-type CDK10 (wt) and a kinase dead (kd) mutant bearing a D181A amino acid substitution that abolishes ATP binding (12). We expressed cyclin M-V5-6His and/or Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) in a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293). The expression level of cyclin M-V5-6His was significantly increased upon coexpression with Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) and, to a lesser extent, that of Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) was increased upon coexpression with cyclin M-V5-6His (Fig. 1D). We then immunoprecipitated Myc-CDK10 proteins and detected the presence of cyclin M in the CDK10 (wt) and (kd) immunoprecipitates only when these proteins were coexpressed pair-wise (Fig. 1E). We confirmed these observations by detecting the presence of Myc-CDK10 in cyclin M-V5-6His immunoprecipitates (Fig. S1B). These experiments confirmed the lack of robust interaction between the CDK10.P2 isoform and cyclin M (Fig. S1C). To detect the interaction between endogenous proteins, we performed immunoprecipitations on nontransfected MCF7 cells derived from a human breast cancer. CDK10 and cyclin M antibodies detected their cognate endogenous proteins by Western blotting. We readily detected cyclin M in immunoprecipitates obtained with the CDK10 antibody but not with a control antibody (Fig. 1F). These results confirm the physical interaction between CDK10 and cyclin M in human cells.To unveil a hypothesized CDK10/cyclin M protein kinase activity, we produced GST-CDK10 and StrepII-cyclin M fusion proteins in insect cells, either individually or in combination. We observed that GST-CDK10 and StrepII-cyclin M copurified, thus confirming their interaction in yet another cellular model (Fig. 2A). We then performed in vitro kinase assays with purified proteins, using histone H1 as a generic substrate. Histone H1 phosphorylation was detected only from lysates of cells coexpressing GST-CDK10 and StrepII-cyclin M. No phosphorylation was detected when GST-CDK10 or StrepII-cyclin M were expressed alone, or when StrepII-cyclin M was coexpressed with GST-CDK10(kd) (Fig. 2A). Next we investigated whether ETS2, which is known to interact with CDK10 (9) (Fig. 1C), is a phosphorylation substrate of CDK10/cyclin M. We detected strong phosphorylation of ETS2 by the GST-CDK10/StrepII-cyclin M purified heterodimer, whereas no phosphorylation was detected using GST-CDK10 alone or GST-CDK10(kd)/StrepII-cyclin M heterodimer (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2.In a new window Download PPTFig. 2.CDK10 is a cyclin M-dependent protein kinase. (A) In vitro protein kinase assay on histone H1. Lysates from insect cells expressing different proteins were purified on a glutathione Sepharose matrix to capture GST-CDK10(wt or kd) fusion proteins alone, or in complex with STR-CycM fusion protein. Purified protein expression levels were analyzed by Western blots (Top and Upper Middle). The kinase activity was determined by autoradiography of histone H1, whose added amounts were visualized by Coomassie staining (Lower Middle and Bottom). (B) Same as in A, using purified recombinant 6His-ETS2 as a substrate.CDK10 silencing has been shown to increase ETS2-driven c-RAF transcription and to activate the MAPK pathway (6). We investigated whether cyclin M is also involved in this regulatory pathway. To aim at a highly specific silencing, we used siRNA pools (mix of four different siRNAs) at low final concentration (10 nM). Both CDK10 and cyclin M siRNA pools silenced the expression of their cognate targets (Fig. 3 A and C and Fig. S2) and, interestingly, the cyclin M siRNA pool also caused a marked decrease in CDK10 protein level (Fig. 3A and Fig. S2B). These results, and those shown in Fig. 1D, suggest that cyclin M binding stabilizes CDK10. Cyclin M silencing induced an increase in c-Raf protein and mRNA levels (Fig. 3 B and C) and in phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 protein levels (Fig. S3B), similarly to CDK10 silencing. As expected from these effects (6), CDK10 and cyclin M silencing both decreased the sensitivity of ER+ MCF7 cells to tamoxifen, to a similar extent. The combined silencing of both genes did not result in a higher resistance to the drug (Fig. S3C). Altogether, these observations demonstrate a functional interaction between cyclin M and CDK10, which negatively controls ETS2.Fig. 3.In a new window Download PPTFig. 3.Cyclin M silencing up-regulates c-Raf expression. (A) Western blot analysis of endogenous CDK10 and cyclin M expression levels in MCF7 cells, in response to siRNA-mediated gene silencing.

ETS2 is a short-lived protein degraded by the proteasome (13). A straightforward hypothesis is that CDK10/cyclin M positively controls ETS2 degradation. We thus examined the impact of CDK10 or cyclin M silencing on ETS2 expression levels. The silencing of CDK10 and that of cyclin M caused an increase in the expression levels of an exogenously expressed Flag-ETS2 protein (Fig. S4A), as well as of the endogenous ETS2 protein (Fig. 4A). This increase is not attributable to increased ETS2 mRNA levels, which marginally fluctuated in response to CDK10 or cyclin M silencing (Fig. S4B). We then examined the expression levels of the Flag-tagged ETS2 protein when expressed alone or in combination with Myc-CDK10 or -CDK10(kd), with or without cyclin M-V5-6His. Flag-ETS2 was readily detected when expressed alone or, to a lesser extent, when coexpressed with CDK10(kd). However, its expression level was dramatically decreased when coexpressed with CDK10 alone, or with CDK10 and cyclin M (Fig. 4B). These observations suggest that endogenous cyclin M levels are in excess compared with those of CDK10 in MCF7 cells, and they show that the major decrease in ETS2 levels observed upon CDK10 coexpression involves CDK10 kinase activity. Treatment of cells coexpressing Flag-ETS2, CDK10, and cyclin M with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 largely rescued Flag-ETS2 expression levels (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4.In a new window Download PPTFig. 4.CDK10/cyclin M controls ETS2 stability in human cancer derived cells.

(B) Western blot analysis of exogenously expressed Flag-ETS2 protein levels in MCF7 cells cotransfected with empty vectors or coexpressing Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd), or Myc-CDK10/CycM-V5-6His. The latter cells were treated for 16 h with the MG132 proteasome inhibitor. Proper expression of CDK10 and cyclin M tagged proteins was verified by Western blot analysis. (C and D) Western blot analysis of expression levels of exogenously expressed Flag-ETS2 wild-type or mutant proteins in MCF7 cells, in the absence of (C) or in response to (D) Myc-CDK10/CycM-V5-6His expression. Quantifications are shown in Fig. S4 C and D.A mass spectrometry analysis of recombinant ETS2 phosphorylated by CDK10/cyclin M in vitro revealed the existence of multiple phosphorylated residues, among which are two neighboring phospho-serines (at positions 220 and 225) that may form a phosphodegron (14) (Figs. S5â€“S8). To confirm this finding, we compared the phosphorylation level of recombinant ETS2wt with that of ETS2SASA protein, a mutant bearing alanine substitutions of these two serines. As expected from the existence of multiple phosphorylation sites, we detected a small but reproducible, significant decrease of phosphorylation level of ETS2SASA compared with ETS2wt (Fig. S9), thus confirming that Ser220/Ser225 are phosphorylated by CDK10/cyclin M. To establish a direct link between ETS2 phosphorylation by CDK10/cyclin M and degradation, we examined the expression levels of Flag-ETS2SASA. In the absence of CDK10/cyclin M coexpression, it did not differ significantly from that of Flag-ETS2. This is contrary to that of Flag-ETS2DBM, bearing a deletion of the N-terminal destruction (D-) box that was previously shown to be involved in APC-Cdh1â€“mediated degradation of ETS2 (13) (Fig. 4C). However, contrary to Flag-ETS2 wild type, the expression level of Flag-ETS2SASA remained insensitive to CDK10/cyclin M coexpression (Fig. 4D). Altogether, these results suggest that CDK10/cyclin M directly controls ETS2 degradation through the phosphorylation of these two serines.Finally, we studied a lymphoblastoid cell line derived from a patient with STAR syndrome, bearing FAM58A mutation c.555+1G&gt;A, predicted to result in aberrant splicing (10). In accordance with incomplete skewing of X chromosome inactivation previously found in this patient, we detected a decreased expression level of cyclin M protein in the STAR cell line, compared with a control lymphoblastoid cell line. In line with our preceding observations, we detected an increased expression level of ETS2 protein in the STAR cell line compared with the control (Fig. 5A and Fig. S10A). We then examined by quantitative RT-PCR the mRNA expression levels of the corresponding genes. The STAR cell line showed a decreased expression level of cyclin M mRNA but an expression level of ETS2 mRNA similar to that of the control cell line (Fig. 5B). To demonstrate that the increase in ETS2 protein expression is indeed a result of the decreased cyclin M expression observed in the STAR patient-derived cell line, we expressed cyclin M-V5-6His in this cell line. This expression caused a decrease in ETS2 protein levels (Fig. 5C).Fig. 5.In a new window Download PPTFig. 5.Decreased cyclin M expression in STAR patient-derived cells results in increased ETS2 protein level.

(C) Western blot analysis of ETS2 protein levels in the STAR patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell line transfected with an empty vector or a vector directing the expression of cyclin M-V5-6His. Another Western blot revealing endogenously and exogenously expressed cyclin M levels is shown in Fig. S10B. A quantification of ETS2 protein levels is shown in Fig. S10C.Previous SectionNext SectionDiscussionIn this work, we unveil the interaction between CDK10, the last orphan CDK discovered in the pregenomic era (2), and cyclin M, the only cyclin associated with a human genetic disease so far, and whose functions remain unknown (10). The closest paralogs of CDK10 within the CDK family are the CDK11 proteins, which interact with L-type cyclins (15). Interestingly, the closest paralog of these cyclins within the cyclin family is cyclin M (Fig. S11). The fact that none of the shorter CDK10 isoforms interact robustly with cyclin M suggests that alternative splicing of the CDK10 gene (16, 17) plays an important role in regulating CDK10 functions.The functional relevance of the interaction between CDK10 and cyclin M is supported by different observations. Both proteins seem to enhance each otherâ€™s stability, as judged from their increased expression levels when their partner is exogenously coexpressed (Fig. 1D) and from the much reduced endogenous CDK10 expression level observed in response to cyclin M silencing (Fig. 3A and Fig. S2B). CDK10 is subject to ubiquitin-mediated degradation (18). Our observations suggest that cyclin M protects CDK10 from such degradation and that it is the only cyclin partner of CDK10, at least in MCF7 cells. They also suggest that cyclin M stability is enhanced upon binding to CDK10, independently from its kinase activity, as seen for cyclin C and CDK8 (19). We uncover a cyclin M-dependent CDK10 protein kinase activity in vitro, thus demonstrating that this protein, which was named a CDK on the sole basis of its amino acid sequence, is indeed a genuine cyclin-dependent kinase. Our Y2H assays reveal that truncated cyclin M proteins corresponding to the hypothetical products of two STAR syndrome-associated FAM58A mutations do not produce an interaction phenotype with CDK10. Hence, regardless of whether these mutated mRNAs undergo nonsense-mediated decay (as suggested from the decreased cyclin M mRNA levels in STAR cells, shown in Fig. 5B) or give rise to truncated cyclin M proteins, females affected by the STAR syndrome must exhibit compromised CDK10/cyclin M kinase activity at least in some tissues and during specific developmental stages.We show that ETS2, a known interactor of CDK10, is a phosphorylation substrate of CDK10/cyclin M in vitro and that CDK10/cyclin M kinase activity positively controls ETS2 degradation by the proteasome. This control seems to be exerted through a very fine mechanism, as judged from the sensitivity of ETS2 levels to partially decreased CDK10 and cyclin M levels, achieved in MCF7 cells and observed in STAR cells, respectively. These findings offer a straightforward explanation for the already reported up-regulation of ETS2-driven transcription of c-RAF in response to CDK10 silencing (6). We bring evidence that CDK10/cyclin M directly controls ETS2 degradation through the phosphorylation of two neighboring serines, which may form a noncanonical Î²-TRCP phosphodegron (DSMCPAS) (14). Because none of these two serines precede a proline, they do not conform to usual CDK phosphorylation sites. However, multiple so-called transcriptional CDKs (CDK7, -8, -9, and -11) (to which CDK10 may belong; Fig. S11) have been shown to phosphorylate a variety of motifs in a nonâ€“proline-directed fashion, especially in the context of molecular docking with the substrate (20). Here, it can be hypothesized that the high-affinity interaction between CDK10 and the Pointed domain of ETS2 (6, 9) (Fig. 1C) would allow docking-mediated phosphorylation of atypical sites. The control of ETS2 degradation involves a number of players, including APC-Cdh1 (13) and the cullin-RING ligase CRL4 (21). The formal identification of the ubiquitin ligase involved in the CDK10/cyclin M pathway and the elucidation of its concerted action with the other ubiquitin ligases to regulate ETS2 degradation will require further studies.Our results present a number of significant biological and medical implications. First, they shed light on the regulation of ETS2, which plays an important role in development (22) and is frequently deregulated in many cancers (23). Second, our results contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms causing tamoxifen resistance associated with reduced CDK10 expression levels, and they suggest that, like CDK10 (6), cyclin M could also be a predictive clinical marker of hormone therapy response of ERÎ±-positive breast cancer patients. Third, our findings offer an interesting hypothesis on the molecular mechanisms underlying STAR syndrome. Ets2 transgenic mice showing a less than twofold overexpression of Ets2 present severe cranial abnormalities (24), and those observed in STAR patients could thus be caused at least in part by increased ETS2 protein levels. Another expected consequence of enhanced ETS2 expression levels would be a decreased risk to develop certain types of cancers and an increased risk to develop others. Studies on various mouse models (including models of Down syndrome, in which three copies of ETS2 exist) have revealed that ETS2 dosage can repress or promote tumor growth and, hence, that ETS2 exerts noncell autonomous functions in cancer (25). Intringuingly, one of the very few STAR patients identified so far has been diagnosed with a nephroblastoma (26). Finally, our findings will facilitate the general exploration of the biological functions of CDK10 and, in particular, its role in the control of cell division. Previous studies have suggested either a positive role in cell cycle control (5, 6) or a tumor-suppressive activity in some cancers (7, 8). The severe growth retardation exhibited by STAR patients strongly suggests that CDK10/cyclin M plays an important role in the control of cell proliferation.Previous SectionNext SectionMaterials and MethodsCloning of CDK10 and cyclin M cDNAs, plasmid constructions, tamoxifen response analysis, quantitative RT-PCR, mass spectrometry experiments, and antibody production are detailed in SI Materials and Methods.Yeast Two-Hybrid Interaction Assays. We performed yeast interaction mating assays as previously described (27).Mammalian Cell Cultures and Transfections. We grew human HEK293 and MCF7 cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS (Invitrogen), and we grew lymphoblastoid cells in RPMI 1640 GlutaMAX supplemented with 15% (vol/vol) FBS. We transfected HEK293 and MCF7 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for plasmids, Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) for siRNAs, and Jetprime (Polyplus) for plasmids/siRNAs combinations according to the manufacturersâ€™ instructions. We transfected lymphoblastoid cells by electroporation (Neon, Invitrogen). For ETS2 stability studies we treated MCF7 cells 32 h after transfection with 10 Î¼M MG132 (Fisher Scientific) for 16 h.Coimmunoprecipitation and Western Blot Experiments. We collected cells by scraping in PBS (or centrifugation for lymphoblastoid cells) and lysed them by sonication in a lysis buffer containing 60 mM Î²-glycerophosphate, 15 mM p-nitrophenylphosphate, 25 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (Mops) (pH 7.2), 15 mM EGTA, 15 mM MgCl2, 1 mM Na vanadate, 1 mM NaF, 1mM phenylphosphate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). We spun the lysates 15 min at 20,000 Ã— g at 4 Â°C, collected the supernatants, and determined the protein content using a Bradford assay. We performed the immunoprecipitation experiments on 500 Î¼g of total proteins, in lysis buffer. We precleared the lysates with 20 Î¼L of protein A or G-agarose beads, incubated 1 h 4 Â°C on a rotating wheel. We added 5 Î¼g of antibody to the supernatants, incubated 1 h 4 Â°C on a rotating wheel, added 20 Î¼L of protein A or G-agarose beads, and incubated 1 h 4 Â°C on a rotating wheel. We collected the beads by centrifugation 30 s at 18,000 Ã— g at 4 Â°C and washed three times in a bead buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mM NaF, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and a protease inhibitor coktail (Roche). We directly added sample buffer to the washed pellets, heat-denatured the proteins, and ran the samples on 10% Bis-Tris SDS/PAGE. We transferred the proteins onto Hybond nitrocellulose membranes and processed the blots according to standard procedures. For Western blot experiments, we used the following primary antibodies: anti-Myc (Abcam ab9106, 1:2,000), anti-V5 (Invitrogen R960, 1:5,000), anti-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology B-7, 1:500), anti-CDK10 (Covalab pab0847p, 1:500 or Santa Cruz Biotechnology C-19, 1:500), anti-CycM (home-made, dilution 1:500 or Covalab pab0882-P, dilution 1:500), anti-Raf1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology C-20, 1:1,000), anti-ETS2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology C-20, 1:1,000), anti-Flag (Sigma F7425, 1:1,000), and anti-actin (Sigma A5060, 1:5,000). We used HRP-coupled anti-goat (Santa Cruz Biotechnology SC-2033, dilution 1:2,000), anti-mouse (Bio-Rad 170â€“6516, dilution 1:3,000) or anti-rabbit (Bio-Rad 172â€“1019, 1:5,000) as secondary antibodies. We revealed the blots by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Femto, Thermo Scientific).Production and Purification of Recombinant Proteins.GST-CDK10(kd)/StrepII-CycM. We generated recombinant bacmids in DH10Bac Escherichia coli and baculoviruses in Sf9 cells using the Bac-to-Bac system, as described by the provider (Invitrogen). We infected Sf9 cells with GST-CDK10- (or GST-CDK10kd)-producing viruses, or coinfected the cells with StrepII-CycMâ€“producing viruses, and we collected the cells 72 h after infection. To purify GST-fusion proteins, we spun 250 mL cells and resuspended the pellet in 40 mL lysis buffer (PBS, 250 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM Î²-glycerophosphate, and 0.3 mM Na-vanadate) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). We lysed the cells by sonication, spun the lysate 30 min at 15,000 Ã— g, collected the soluble fraction, and added it to a 1-mL glutathione-Sepharose matrix. We incubated 1 h at 4 Â°C, washed four times with lysis buffer, one time with kinase buffer A (see below), and finally resuspended the beads in 100 Î¼L kinase buffer A containing 10% (vol/vol) glycerol for storage.6His-ETS2. We transformed Origami2 DE3 (Novagen) with the 6His-ETS2 expression vector. We induced expression with 0.2 mM isopropyl-Î²-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 22 Â°C. To purify 6His-ETS2, we spun 50 mL cells and resuspended the pellet in 2 mL lysis buffer (PBS, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole, 1 mM DTT, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing a protease inhibitor mixture without EDTA (Roche). We lysed the cells at 1.6 bar using a cell disruptor and spun the lysate 10 min at 20,000 Ã— g. We collected the soluble fraction and added it to 200 Î¼L Cobalt beads (Thermo Scientific). After 1 h incubation at 4 Â°C on a rotating wheel, we washed four times with lysis buffer. To elute, we incubated beads 30 min with elution buffer (PBS, 250 mM imidazole, pH 7.6) containing the protease inhibitor mixture, spun 30 s at 10,000 Ã— g, and collected the eluted protein.Protein Kinase Assays. We mixed glutathione-Sepharose beads (harboring GST-CDK10 wt or kd, either monomeric or complexed with StrepII-CycM), 22.7 Î¼M BSA, 15 mM DTT, 100 Î¼M ATP, 5 Î¼Ci ATP[Î³-32P], 7.75 Î¼M histone H1, or 1 Î¼M 6His-ETS2 and added kinase buffer A (25 mM TrisÂ·HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, and 3.7 Î¼M heparin, pH 7.5) up to a total volume of 30 Î¼L. We incubated the reactions 30 min at 30 Â°C, added Laemli sample buffer, heat-denatured the samples, and ran 10% Bis-Tris SDS/PAGE. We cut gel slices to detect GST-CDK10 and StrepII-CycM by Western blotting. We stained the gel slices containing the substrate with Coomassie (R-250, Bio-Rad), dried them, and detected the incorporated radioactivity by autoradiography. We identified four unrelated girls with anogenital and renal malformations, dysmorphic facial features, normal intellect and syndactyly of toes. A similar combination of features had been reported previously in a motherâ€“daughter pair1 (Table 1 and Supplementary Note online). These authors noted clinical overlap with Townes-Brocks syndrome but suggested that the phenotype represented a separate autosomal dominant entity (MIM601446). Here we define the cardinal features of this syndrome as a characteristic facial appearance with apparent telecanthus and broad tripartite nasal tip, variable syndactyly of toes 2â€“5, hypoplastic labia, anal atresia and urogenital malformations (Fig. 1aâ€“h). We also observed a variety of other features (Table 1).  Figure 1: Clinical and molecular characterization of STAR syndrome.  Figure 1 : Clinical and molecular characterization of STAR syndrome. (aâ€“f) Facial appearances of cases 1â€“3 (apparent telecanthus, dysplastic ears and thin upper lips; a,c,e), and toe syndactyly 2â€“5, 3â€“5 or 4â€“5 (b,d,f) in these cases illustrate recognizable features of STAR syndrome (specific parental consent has been obtained for publication of these photographs). Anal atresia and hypoplastic labia are not shown. (g,h) X-ray films of the feet of case 2 showing only four rays on the left and delta-shaped 4th and 5th metatarsals on the right (h; compare to clinical picture in d). (i) Array-CGH data. Log2 ratio represents copy number loss of six probes spanning between 37.9 and 50.7 kb, with one probe positioned within FAM58A. The deletion does not remove parts of other functional genes. (j) Schematic structure of FAM58A and position of the mutations. FAM58A has five coding exons (boxes). The cyclin domain (green) is encoded by exons 2â€“4. The horizontal arrow indicates the deletion extending 5' in case 1, which includes exons 1 and 2, whereas the horizontal line below exon 5 indicates the deletion found in case 3, which removes exon 5 and some 3' sequence. The pink horizontal bars above the boxes indicate the amplicons used for qPCR and sequencing (one alternative exon 5 amplicon is not indicated because of space constraints). The mutation 201dupT (case 4) results in an immediate stop codon, and the 555+1G&gt;A and 555-1G&gt;A splice mutations in cases 2, 5 and 6 are predicted to be deleterious because they alter the conserved splice donor and acceptor site of intron 4, respectively.  Full size image (97 KB)  Table 1: Clinical features in STAR syndrome cases  Table 1 - Clinical features in STAR syndrome cases  Full table  On the basis of the phenotypic overlap with Townes-Brocks, Okihiro and Feingold syndromes, we analyzed SALL1 (ref. 2), SALL4 (ref. 3) and MYCN4 but found no mutations in any of these genes (Supplementary Methods online). Next, we carried out genome-wide high-resolution oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)5 analysis (Supplementary Methods) of genomic DNA from the most severely affected individual (case 1, with lower lid coloboma, epilepsy and syringomyelia) and identified a heterozygous deletion of 37.9â€“50.7 kb on Xq28, which removed exons 1 and 2 of FAM58A (Fig. 1i,j). Using real-time PCR, we confirmed the deletion in the child and excluded it in her unaffected parents (Supplementary Fig. 1a online, Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 1 online). Through CGH with a customized oligonucleotide array enriched in probes for Xq28, followed by breakpoint cloning, we defined the exact deletion size as 40,068 bp (g.152,514,164_152,554,231del(chromosome X, NCBI Build 36.2); Fig. 1j and Supplementary Figs. 2,3 online). The deletion removes the coding regions of exons 1 and 2 as well as intron 1 (2,774 bp), 492 bp of intron 2, and 36,608 bp of 5' sequence, including the 5' UTR and the entire KRT18P48 pseudogene (NCBI gene ID 340598). Paternity was proven using routine methods. We did not find deletions overlapping FAM58A in the available copy number variation (CNV) databases.  Subsequently, we carried out qPCR analysis of the three other affected individuals (cases 2, 3 and 4) and the mother-daughter pair from the literature (cases 5 and 6). In case 3, we detected a de novo heterozygous deletion of 1.1â€“10.3 kb overlapping exon 5 (Supplementary Fig. 1b online). Using Xq28-targeted array CGH and breakpoint cloning, we identified a deletion of 4,249 bp (g.152,504,123_152,508,371del(chromosome X, NCBI Build 36.2); Fig. 1j and Supplementary Figs. 2,3), which removed 1,265 bp of intron 4, all of exon 5, including the 3' UTR, and 2,454 bp of 3' sequence.  We found heterozygous FAM58A point mutations in the remaining cases (Fig. 1j, Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 1). In case 2, we identified the mutation 555+1G&gt;A, affecting the splice donor site of intron 4. In case 4, we identified the frameshift mutation 201dupT, which immediately results in a premature stop codon N68XfsX1. In cases 5 and 6, we detected the mutation 556-1G&gt;A, which alters the splice acceptor site of intron 4. We validated the point mutations and deletions by independent rounds of PCR and sequencing or by qPCR. We confirmed paternity and de novo status of the point mutations and deletions in all sporadic cases. None of the mutations were seen in the DNA of 60 unaffected female controls, and no larger deletions involving FAM58A were found in 93 unrelated array-CGH investigations.  By analyzing X-chromosome inactivation (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. 4 online), we found complete skewing of X inactivation in cases 1 and 3â€“6 and almost complete skewing in case 2, suggesting that cells carrying the mutation on the active X chromosome have a growth disadvantage during fetal development. Using RT-PCR on RNA from lymphoblastoid cells of case 2 (Supplementary Fig. 2), we did not find any aberrant splice products as additional evidence that the mutated allele is inactivated. Furthermore, FAM58A is subjected to X inactivation6. In cases 1 and 3, the parental origin of the deletions could not be determined, as a result of lack of informative SNPs. Case 5, the mother of case 6, gave birth to two boys, both clinically unaffected (samples not available). We cannot exclude that the condition is lethal in males. No fetal losses were reported from any of the families.  The function of FAM58A is unknown. The gene consists of five coding exons, and the 642-bp coding region encodes a protein of 214 amino acids. GenBank lists a mRNA length of 1,257 bp for the reference sequence (NM_152274.2). Expression of the gene (by EST data) was found in 27 of 48 adult tissues including kidney, colon, cervix and uterus, but not heart (NCBI expression viewer, UniGene Hs.496943). Expression was also noted in 24 of 26 listed tumor tissues as well as in embryo and fetus. Genes homologous to FAM58A (NCBI HomoloGene: 13362) are found on the X chromosome in the chimpanzee and the dog. The zebrafish has a similar gene on chromosome 23. However, in the mouse and rat, there are no true homologs. These species have similar but intronless genes on chromosomes 11 (mouse) and 10 (rat), most likely arising from a retrotransposon insertion event. On the murine X chromosome, the flanking genes Atp2b3 and Dusp9 are conserved, but only remnants of the FAM58A sequence can be detected.  FAM58A contains a cyclin-box-fold domain, a protein-binding domain found in cyclins with a role in cell cycle and transcription control. No human phenotype resulting from a cyclin gene mutation has yet been reported. Homozygous knockout mice for Ccnd1 (encoding cyclin D1) are viable but small and have reduced lifespan. They also have dystrophic changes of the retina, likely as a result of decreased cell proliferation and degeneration of photoreceptor cells during embryogenesis7, 8.  Cyclin D1 colocalizes with SALL4 in the nucleus, and both proteins cooperatively mediate transcriptional repression9. As the phenotype of our cases overlaps considerably with that of Townes-Brocks syndrome caused by SALL1 mutations1, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation to find out if SALL1 or SALL4 would interact with FAM58A in a manner similar to that observed for SALL4 and cyclin D1. We found that FAM58A interacts with SALL1 but not with SALL4 (Supplementary Fig. 5 online), supporting the hypothesis that FAM58A and SALL1 participate in the same developmental pathway.  How do FAM58A mutations lead to STAR syndrome? Growth retardation (all cases; Table 1) and retinal abnormalities (three cases) are reminiscent of the reduced body size and retinal anomalies in cyclin D1 knockout mice7, 8. Therefore, a proliferation defect might be partly responsible for STAR syndrome. To address this question, we carried out a knockdown of FAM58A mRNA followed by a proliferation assay. Transfection of HEK293 cells with three different FAM58A-specific RNAi oligonucleotides resulted in a significant reduction of both FAM58A mRNA expression and proliferation of transfected cells (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. 6 online), supporting the link between FAM58A and cell proliferation.  We found that loss-of-function mutations of FAM58A result in a rather homogeneous clinical phenotype. The additional anomalies in case 1 are likely to result from an effect of the 40-kb deletion on expression of a neighboring gene, possibly ATP2B3 or DUSP9. However, we cannot exclude that the homogeneous phenotype results from an ascertainment bias and that FAM58A mutations, including missense changes, could result in a broader spectrum of malformations. The genes causing the overlapping phenotypes of STAR syndrome and Townes-Brocks syndrome seem to act in the same pathway. Of note, MYCN, a gene mutated in Feingold syndrome, is a direct regulator of cyclin D2 (refs. 10,11); thus, it is worth exploring whether the phenotypic similarities between Feingold and STAR syndrome might be explained by direct regulation of FAM58A by MYCN.  FAM58A is located approximately 0.56 Mb centromeric to MECP2 on Xq28. Duplications overlapping both MECP2 and FAM58A have been described and are not associated with a clinical phenotype in females12, but no deletions overlapping both MECP2 and FAM58A have been observed to date13. Although other genes between FAM58A and MECP2 have been implicated in brain development, FAM58A and MECP2 are the only genes in this region known to result in X-linked dominant phenotypes; thus, deletion of both genes on the same allele might be lethal in both males and females.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Abstract Background  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a heterogeneous group of disorders with a number of genetic and proteomic alterations. c-CBL is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and adaptor molecule important in normal homeostasis and cancer. We determined the genetic variations of c-CBL, relationship to receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR and MET), and functionality in NSCLC.  Methods and Findings  Using archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) extracted genomic DNA, we show that c-CBL mutations occur in somatic fashion for lung cancers. c-CBL mutations were not mutually exclusive of MET or EGFR mutations; however they were independent of p53 and KRAS mutations. In normal/tumor pairwise analysis, there was significant loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for the c-CBL locus (22%, nâ€Š=â€Š8/37) and none of these samples revealed any mutation in the remaining copy of c-CBL. The c-CBL LOH also positively correlated with EGFR and MET mutations observed in the same samples. Using select c-CBL somatic mutations such as S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* (obtained from Caucasian, Taiwanese and African-American samples, respectively) transfected in NSCLC cell lines, there was increased cell viability and cell motility.  Conclusions  Taking the overall mutation rate of c-CBL to be a combination as somatic missense mutation and LOH, it is clear that c-CBL is highly mutated in lung cancers and may play an essential role in lung tumorigenesis and metastasis.  Go to: Introduction In the US alone, each year approximately 219,400 people are diagnosed with lung cancers, out of which more than 145,000 of them succumb to the disease [1]. This number is roughly equivalent to the combined mortality rates of cancers of the breast, prostate, colon, liver, kidney and melanoma [1]. In addition the prognosis is usually poor and the five-year survival rate is less than 15%. There are also significant ethnic differences for lung cancer, and the outcome is worse for blacks compared to whites. Gender differences are also striking with women having significantly better prognosis as compared to men. There are a number of genetic alterations that can occur in lung cancer. As an example, in NSCLC, mutations in KRAS, p53, EGFR and MET have been identified. Many of these pathways, especially Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) are controlled by c-CBL.  CBL (Casitas B-lineage lymphoma) is a mammalian gene located on human chromosome 11q23.3 [2] and is involved in cell signaling and protein ubiquitination [3]. CBL proteins belong to the RING finger class of ubiquitin ligases (E3) and there are three homologues c-CBL, CBL-b, CBL-3 [4]. The c-CBL and CBL-b genes are ubiquitously expressed with the highest levels in hematopoietic tissues [5]. c-CBL consists of four regions encoding for functionally distinct protein domains: the N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain, the linker region, the catalytic RING finger domain, the proline-rich region and the c-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain that also overlaps with a leucine-zipper (LZ) domain [3]. Both TKB and RING finger domains are essential for ligand-induced ubiquitination of RTKs [6], [7], [8], [9]. The RING finger domain is required for the recruitment of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. The TKB domain includes four-helix bundle (4H), a calcium-biding EF hand, and a modified SH2 domain, which binds to phosphotyrosine residues [3], [10], [11], [12]. In addition, the proline-rich region of c-CBL can associate with the SH3 domain of Grb2, which can indirectly recruit c-CBL to RTKs via the GRB2 adaptor protein [7], [13], [14].  c-CBL also binds to EGFR and acts as the E3 that targets EGFR for ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, CBL desensitizes EGF signaling and opposes cellular proliferation induced by EGF [15]. EGF activation also appears to activate the tyrosine kinase SRC, which phosphorylates c-CBL and in turn activates the ubiquitination and degradation of EGFR [16], [17], [18]. A recent study shows that defective endocytosis of EGFR is characterized by a deletion mutant and the point mutation L858R, whereby its association with c-CBL and subsequent ubiquitination are impaired [19]. Recently, the first human c-CBL mutations were reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients [20]. The mutation R420Q inhibits FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitination [20].  Not only can E3 activity be important in oncogenesis, c-CBL has a dual but separate function as a signal transduction molecule. We have previously shown that c-CBL is important in binding CRKL and BCR/ABL in hematopoietic cells. Also, it can bind and modulate functions of cytoskeleton by binding to proteins like talin and paxillin. The TKB domain is important in binding to a number of molecules, and they then function in signal transduction.  Given the critical role of CBL in normal homeostasis and cancer, we hypothesized that it might be mutated in lung cancers. In this study, we report novel c-CBL somatic mutations S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* in Caucasian, Taiwanese and African-American lung cancer patients, respectively. Expressing these mutations in NSCLC cell lines lead to increased proliferation and cell motility. We show that c-CBL mutations occur with or without MET or EGFR mutations but are mutually exclusive of a LOH at the c-CBL locus. Additionally, c-CBL LOH is associated with either MET or EGFR mutations. We thus hypothesize that c-CBL mutations might contribute to the oncogenic potential of MET and EGFR in lung cancer.  Go to: Methods Ethics Statement  Written consent on all research on human subjects has been obtained from the Institutional Review Board, University of Chicago and covers all research performed in the laboratory. The following is their contact information: Institutional Review Board, The University of Chicago, McGiffert Hall, 5751 S. Woodlawn Ave., 2nd floor, Chicago, IL 60637. Written informed consents were received from all patients whose tissue samples were used for this study.  Tissue Samples  Lung cancer tissue and paired adjacent normal lung tissues were obtained from 50 Caucasian, 29 African-Americans and 40 Taiwanese NSCLC patients who were recruited at the University of Chicago Hospital (Chicago, USA) (Caucasian and African-American patients) and Taipei Veterans General Hospital of Taiwan (Taiwanese patients) after obtaining appropriate Institutional Review Board permission and informed consent from the patients. Out of 119 samples, 77 were men, 38 were women and 4 were unknown with age at diagnosis ranging from 47 to 90 years. In terms of tumor types, 53 were adenocarcinoma, 32 were squamous cell carcinoma and 34 were large cell carcinoma. 49 were stage I, 14 were stage II, 34 were stage III, and 13 were stage IV (Table S1).  Cell Culture  Human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells A549 and H358 were maintained in DMEM and RPMI-1640, respectively. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in DMEM. Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 Âµg/ml of streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were cultured at 37Â°C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.  c-CBL Gene Mutational Analysis  Exons 2 to 16 of c-CBL gene were individually amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers are listed in Table S2. PCR conditions were 1 cycle of 95Â°C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles of 94Â°C for 30 seconds, 58Â°C for 30 seconds and 72Â°C for 2 minutes; and one cycle of 72Â°C for 10 minutes. PCR products were treated with ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH) and sequenced by Big-Dye Terminator Chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequencing was performed on the forward coding strand with confirmation of c-CBL alterations performed by sequencing the reverse strand as well. Chromatograms were analyzed for mutations using Mutation Surveyor v2.61 (Softgenetics, State College, PA).  Plasmid Constructs and Site-Directed Mutagenesis  The wild-type c-CBL cDNA insert was subcloned into the pAlterMax expression vector using XhoI and SalI restriction enzyme sites (Promega, Madison, WI). Using this parental plasmid pAlterMax-c-CBL, the TKB domain double mutation (S80N/H94Y), the point mutation (Q249E), and the C-terminal point mutation W802* of c-CBL were created using the following primers: 5â€²-GCTGGCGCTAAAGAATAACCCACCTTATATCTTAGAC-3â€² and 5â€²-CTACCAGATACCTACCAGTATCTCCGTACTATCTTGTC-3â€² for the double mutation S80N/H94Y; 5â€²-CTTTACCCGACTCTTTGAGCCCTGGTCCTCTTTGC-3â€² for Q249E, and 5â€²-CAGCTCCTCCTTTGGCTGATTGTCTCTGGATGGTGATC-3â€² for W802* along with their complementary primers using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis XL kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The constructs were confirmed for the point mutations by standard DNA sequencing of both strands.  Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) Analysis  Five microsatellites on chromosome 11 (3 on 11q at or within 200 kb up or downstream of the c-CBL gene and 2 control markers on 11p) were selected for analysis (Table S3). Established microsatellite markers and respective primer sequences were selected from the GeneLoc database (http://genecards.weizmann.ac.il/geneloc/index.shtml, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel). Primers were custom designed and each forward primer was fluorescently labeled at the 5â€² end with FAM, PET, NED, or VIC (Applied Biosystems). Primer annealing temperatures and duplex scores were evaluated with NIST Primer Tools (http://yellow.nist.gov:8444/dnaAnalysis/primerToolsPage.do; National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD). Primers were verified by performing PCR with control DNA (isolated from TK6 cells) and resolving the products on agarose gels. Bands were visualized with an UV transilluminator. Genomic DNA was extracted from tumor samples and paired normal lung tissue. Primers were grouped into multiplex combinations shown in Table S4. Marker D11S929 served as an internal control to check for consistency in PCRs and of peaks from capillary electrophoresis. Multiplex PCRs were carried out in a volume of 10 ÂµL that contained 1 ÂµL genomic DNA (20â€“50 ng), 0.5 ÂµM of each primer (1.0 ÂµM total for each primer pair), 400 ÂµM dNTPs, 1X PCR buffer containing MgCl2, and 0.2 U Taq DNA polymerase. PCR was performed on the ABI GeneAmp 9700 PCR System under the following conditions: 5 min at 94Â°C; 30 cycles of 30 sec at 94Â°C, 1 min at 60Â°C, 1 min at 72Â°C; and 5 min at 72Â°C. The PCR products were separated by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI 3130XL DNA Analyzer. Chromatograms were analyzed with Peak Scanner 1.0 and GeneMapper 3.7 software (Applied Biosystems) for allelic alterations. The area of the peaks produced by the DNA PCR products was quantified for each allele. The ratio of the allelic areas was calculated for each tumor and paired normal DNA sample. When the qLOH (allelic ratio for the tumor peaks divided by the allelic ratio of paired normal sample) was â‰¤0.5 or â‰¥2.0 for c-CBL and at least one other 11q marker in at least two separate experiments, the sample was considered as having an allelic imbalance and interpreted as LOH. Samples were evaluated in at least two separate experiments and samples showing prospective LOH at c-CBL repeated a third time which included a new control marker at the BAX locus (data not shown) on chromosome 19 to verify integrity of sample DNA.  Transfection of c-Cbl Constructs  The A549 cell line was transfected using the Fugene HD (Roche, Nutley, NJ) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eight Âµg of plasmid DNA, containing either no insert (empty vector), wild-type c-CBL, S80N/H94Y c-CBL, Q249E c-CBL or W802* CBL was used for transfection in a 6-well culture plate. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and analyzed for expression.  c-CBL Knockdown  c-CBL knockdown was performed using lentiviral transduction using MISSION lentiviral transduction particles (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as per manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1Ã—105 H358 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates and infected the following day with c-CBL lentiviral shRNA constructs. To generate stable c-CBL knockdown cell lines, cells were selected for 2 days with 1 Âµg/ml puromycin. c-CBL levels were determined using whole cell lysates by immunoblotting with anti-CBL antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA).  Cell Viability Assay  Cells were transfected as described above in the transfection assay. Forty-eight hours after transfection, viability of cells was assessed using Trypan Blue exclusion.  Wound Healing Assay  A549 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured for 48 h until 100% confluent. The medium was then changed and the cells were transfected as described in the transfection assay. Twelve hours after transfection, a straight scratch was made across the cell layer using a 1 ml pipette tip. The cells were then gently washed with 1Ã— PBS to remove cellular debris and the media was replaced. Photographs were taken of the wound region every 12 h until 48 h.  Western Blot Analysis  Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were collected and washed twice in 1X PBS, then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5M Tris-HCl with pH 7.4, 1.5 M NaCl, 2.5% deoxycholic acid, 10 mM EDTA, 10% NP-40, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 Âµg/mL leupeptin, and 10 Âµg/mL aprotinin) for 5 minutes. The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4Â°C, and protein content of the supernatant was measured. Total cell lysates (50 Âµg/well) were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and the gels transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman, Piscataway, NJ). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing Tween-20 (PBST) (1X PBS, 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody at 4Â°C overnight. Membranes then were washed three times with PBST and probed with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were again washed three times in PBST and bands were visualized using Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (BioRad, Valencia, CA) on a Chemidoc Gel documentation system (BioRad, Valencia, CA). Antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies and used at the following dilutions (c-CBL, 1âˆ¶5000; c-MET, 1âˆ¶5000; EGFR, 1âˆ¶5000; ubiquitin, 1âˆ¶1000; HA, 1âˆ¶5000 and Î²-actin, 1âˆ¶10,000).  Flow Cytometry  Cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow cytometry. Approximately 2Ã—106 cells were grown in media containing 10% FBS. Cells were harvested by trypsin/EDTA treatment, washed with 1X PBS three times and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 2 h. Cells were washed again with cold PBS and stained with a solution containing 25 Âµg/mL propidium iodide, 200 Âµg/mL RNase A, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes in the dark. Cell cycle analysis was performed using a Guava PCA-96 flow cytometer (Guava Technologies, Millipore, Billerica, MA).  Ubiquitin Ligase Activity  293T cells were maintained in culture in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin (100 units/mL) and streptomycin (100 Âµg/mL) were transfected with 0.2 Âµg EGFR-pcDNA3 and 2 Âµg HA-tagged c-CBL constructs as indicated using calcium phosphate according to manufacturer's protocol (Profection, Promega, Madison, WI). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were starved overnight in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS, and then treated with or without EGF (100 ng/ml) for 15 min. The cells were collected and washed two times in ice-cold PBS containing 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X100, 10% Glycerol, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors). Lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 10 min at 4Â°C. EGFR immunoprecipitations were performed on 200 Âµg of cleared lysate using 250 ng of rabbit-anti-EGFR and Protein A/G Plus Sepharose overnight at 4Â°C. Precipitations were washed 5 times in lysis buffer before boiling in Laemmli buffer. Elutions were immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin and EGFR. Twenty micrograms of cleared lysate were immunoblotted for each of the c-CBL constructs using anti-HA.  Statistical Analysis  Mutation rates between different groups were compared using Fisher's exact test. For continuous variables, group comparisons were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Sidak's adjustment for multiple comparisons. Experiments involving repeated measurements over time were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with the Greenhouse-Geisser adjustment to the degrees of freedom. Analyses were conducted using STATA (v10.1) software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).  Go to: Results c-CBL Gene Mutations in Lung Cancer  To investigate the role of c-CBL in lung cancer, we analyzed its genomic DNA in tumor and paired normal samples drawn from multiple ethnicities. The lung tumor samples represented Caucasians (nâ€Š=â€Š50), African-Americans (nâ€Š=â€Š29), and Taiwanese (nâ€Š=â€Š40) lung cancer patients. We designed 12 pairs of primers to sequence the coding region of c-CBL gene that spans exons 2 to 16 (Table S2). We identified 8 unique somatic mutations in c-CBL exons among 8 different patients. A variation L620F, a known SNP (rs2227988) in exon 11 was also detected. Importantly, the eight novel non-synonymous mutations were confirmed by sequencing both strands of c-CBL genomic DNA obtained from lung tumor samples (Table 1). Moreover, none of the 8 mutations were detected in the corresponding normal tissue, indicating that these were somatic mutations. Four synonymous single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were also identified but were not used further in this study.  Table 1 Table 1 c-CBL mutation analysis in 119 lung cancer patient tumor tissues. Three of the 8 novel non-synonymous mutations were located in the TKB (tyrosine kinase binding) domain (S80N, H94Y, and Q249E), one in the RING finger domain (V391I), one in the proline-rich region (72515_72517 del ATG), and three in the C-terminal region (W802*, R830K, and A848T) of the c-CBL protein (Figure 1A and Figure S1). In Figure 1B, we show model chromatograms of representative samples.  Figure 1 Figure 1 c-CBL mutations and LOH in non-small cell lung cancer. 11q LOH of c-CBL Gene  Paired lung tumor and normal lung tissue samples from Taiwanese patients (nâ€Š=â€Š37) were investigated for LOH. Eight (21.6%) showed LOH at the c-CBL locus on chromosome 11 while 29 samples (78.4%) revealed normal allelic contribution at the microsatellite markers (Figures 1C and D).  c-CBL Mutations in Different Ethnic Groups  The c-CBL double mutant S80N/H94Y was found in the same patient and the overall mutation rate for c-CBL in lung tumors was 6.7% (8/119). The frequency of c-CBL mutation was highest in large cell carcinoma (14.7%; 5 of 34 patients) followed by squamous carcinoma (6.3%; 2 of 32 patients) and the least was observed in adenocarcinoma (AD) (1.8%; 1 of 53 patients), although these rates were not statistically significant (pâ€Š=â€Š0.292). Mutation rates were 6.0% among Caucasians (0 of 20 in AD; 0 of 10 in SQ; and 3 of 20 in LC), 13.8% in African-Americans (1 of 10 in AD; 1 of 10 in SQ; and 2 of 9 in LC), and 2.5% (0 of 23 in AD; 1 of 12 in SQ; and 0 of 5 in LC) in the Taiwanese population. Additionally two Taiwanese patients with lung cancer (one squamous and one adenocarcinoma) had the known SNP L620F. Ethnic differences were not statistically significant, however the power to detect differences was low.  Mutations in MET and EGFR Can Be Co-Associated with c-CBL Alterations  Since East Asians with lung cancer have a higher frequency of EGFR and MET mutations in lung tumors [21], [22], we also determined mutations in EGFR and MET in the same Taiwanese cohort samples and compared the results with the observed c-CBL alterations (LOH and/or mutations). In the 37 samples tested, we did not find any overlap between c-CBL mutations and c-CBL LOH (Figure 2). Of the three c-CBL mutants (including the known L620F SNP, rs2227988), one of the samples had a MET mutation (N375S) and the other had an EGFR mutation (L858R). Among the 8 samples that had a LOH at the c-CBL locus 5 had an additional mutation in MET (N375S) and 2 had an EGFR exon 19 deletion. Twenty-six samples had neither c-CBL mutation nor c-CBL LOH (3 patients had a c-CBL mutation but no c-CBL LOH). Among these 26 samples 9 had a MET mutation (8 N375S, 1 L211W), 13 had an EGFR mutation (7 exon 9 deletion, 6 L858R) and 4 had no other MET or EGFR mutation. Thus the rate of MET or EGFR mutations among patients with LOH at the c-CBL locus (7 of 8) was similar to that seen in patients without c-CBL mutation or LOH (22 of 26 patients) (pâ€Š=â€Š0.99). These 4 patients with no identifiable mutation in c-CBL, MET or EGFR represented 10.8% of the 37 patients analyzed in the Taiwanese patient cohort. Conversely, 89.2% Taiwanese lung cancer patients have an identifiable mutation in either c-CBL, MET or EGFR or a combination of the three genes (Figure 2). Additionally, we determined p53 and KRAS mutations in these Taiwanese cohorts. Two p53 and 1 KRAS mutation were detected. The single KRAS mutation overlapped with one p53 mutation. This patient also had the EGFR exon 19 deletion but had no c-CBL mutation. The other p53 mutation sample had a c-CBL LOH with concurrent MET N375S mutation. Thus, in the Taiwanese samples analyzed, p53/KRAS mutations and c-CBL mutations were mutually exclusive (data not shown).  Figure 2 Figure 2 c-CBL mutations and relationship to MET and EGFR mutations in lung cancer. Cellular Functions of c-CBL Alterations in the Context of Lung Tumorigenesis  A. E3 activity is intact in the mutant c-CBL proteins To investigate whether the different c-CBL mutations affect the E3 activity, EGFR was chosen as a model substrate for c-CBL E3 function. All of the c-CBL mutants tested enhanced ubiquitination of the activated EGFR similar to the wild-type c-CBL protein. This result demonstrates that the catalytic activity of the c-CBL mutants is not impaired when EGFR was the substrate. (Figure 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Ubiquitination, viability, expression and cell cycle analysis of various c-CBL mutants. B. Effect on lung cancer cell viability The effect of a representative c-CBL mutant from each of the three ethnic backgrounds on lung cancer cell viability in cell lines was determined. S80N/H94Y double mutation, Q249E, and W802* were identified in lung tumor samples obtained from a Caucasian, a Taiwanese and an African-American, respectively. As described in methods, the c-CBL wild-type (WT) and the above three mutants were expressed after cloning them into pAlterMax vector in A549 cells. These cells express relatively low basal levels of endogenous c-CBL (data not shown). Transfection efficiency was comparable between different groups and the number of cells transfected with c-CBL wild-type construct was about 70% compared to control cells that were transfected with the empty vector. Cells transfected with S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* c-CBL mutant constructs resulted in increased number of viable cells that was 132.3%, 120.8% and 147.9% higher respectively, relative to the empty vector control transfected cells and significantly different from the wild-type construct (pâ€Š=â€Š0.022, pâ€Š=â€Š0.049, and pâ€Š=â€Š0.008, respectively) (Figure 3B). Relative levels of c-CBL protein in whole cell lysates prepared from samples obtained from a parallel experiment was determined. The c-CBL protein levels in samples representing untransfected and empty vector transfected cells were comparable and those representing the c-CBL WT and the three c-CBL mutants were comparable (Figure 3C).  C. Effect on cell cycle To investigate if the increases in cell viability in different c-CBL mutants are due to increased cellular proliferation, a cell cycle analysis was performed. A549 cells were transfected with the c-CBL WT or the three different mutants: S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802*. The empty vector transfectant was used as a control. Forty-eight hours after transfection cell cycle analysis was performed as described in materials and methods. There was no significant change in the subG1, G1 or the S phase of the cell cycle among the different mutants compared to the WT construct (pâ€Š=â€Š0.64, pâ€Š=â€Š0.40, and pâ€Š=â€Š0.28, respectively). The G2/M phase of the cell cycle showed an increase in cell numbers for the three mutants, S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802*, when compared to the WT but again the difference was not statistically significant (pâ€Š=â€Š0.25) (Figure 3D).  D. Effect on cell motility To investigate the effect of the expression of the above three c-CBL mutants on cell migration, we carried out wound healing assay as described in materials and methods. The closing of the scratch or the wound was monitored at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. (Figure 4A). In all the samples, that represented cells transfected with mutants, the wound gap was much smaller than that seen in the sample that represented cells transfected with c-CBL WT (p&lt;0.001). We also determined the rate of wound closure for all the five groups. At 48 h, wild-type c-CBL transfectants showed 61.1% open wound while the S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* mutants showed 18.7%, 23.9% and 34.3% open wound respectively (p&lt;0.001) (Figure 4B).  Figure 4 Figure 4 c-CBL mutations affect wound healing in A549 cells. E. c-CBL knockdown increases cell viability It is hypothesized that the LOH seen in our samples could lead to decreased expression of c-CBL. Thus we tested the effect of c-CBL knockdown in lung cancer cells. Compared to A549, H358 lung cancer cells express relatively high levels of endogenous c-CBL (data not shown). c-CBL expression was knocked down using lentiviral construct that expressed c-CBL specific shRNA and compared the results with those that were transduced with scrambled shRNA and the results are shown in Figure 5. We identified several clones that revealed varying degrees of c-CBL knockdown showing different sets of c-CBL lentiviral shRNA knockdown efficiency (Figure 5A). Of all the clones tested, Clone 27 was chosen for further experiments. Equal amount of cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and the cell proliferation was measured at various times and the results are depicted in Figure 5B. As expected, number of cells increased in a time dependent fashion from 100 to 190% relative to scrambled shRNA as control in a span of 48 h (pâ€Š=â€Š0.0002) (Figure 5B). The cell cycle phases in H358 cells that were knocked down with c-CBL shRNA were looked at and compared with the scrambled shRNA. There were no discernable differences between these two constructs in the different phases of the cell cycle (data not shown).  Figure 5 Figure 5 Knockdown of c-CBL using an shRNA increases cell proliferation. Go to: Discussion Our results demonstrate that c-CBL is somatically mutated (or has LOH) in lung cancers, and can significantly contribute to enhanced cell viability and motility. There was also a high prevalence of LOH with respect to c-CBL in lung tumors that harbored MET or EGFR mutation.  In the present study, we have demonstrated the occurrence of c-CBL mutations in lung cancer patients, especially with different ancestral variations. Mutations in c-CBL have been recently reported in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and myeloid malignancies. In the AML study, the mutation R420Q located in the junction of the RING finger and the linker region inhibited FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitination [20], thus contributing to the gain-in-function for the RTK. In addition, mutations such as H398Y, C384R, and L380P mapped to the RING finger domain and the linker region of c-CBL that is required for its E3 activity [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. Additionally, homozygous mutations in the RING finger domain of the c-CBL gene were described as a result of acquired Uniparental Disomy (UPD) [26]. It is important to note that our results indicate LOH at 11q23 locus and these are mutually exclusive from missense mutations of c-CBL. The somatic mutations were all heterozygous. The mutations in AML led to abrogation of the E3 activity leading to prolonged RTK activation. In addition mutants located on the linker region surrounding the RING finger domain exhibited enhanced AKT signaling in response to cytokine stimulation [26]. In addition, it was shown in NH3T3 cells, that neither mutations in the RING finger nor the linker region causes transformation, however while certain mutations perturbs the ubiquitination, others affect receptor recycling and prolong kinase activity [28].  We report here c-CBL mutations that mapped not only to the RING finger domain, but also to the TKB domain, proline-rich domain and the C-terminal region, but none mapped to the linker region as reported in the AML studies described above [23], [24], [25], [26], [29]. In addition, 8 mutants that we detected were found in different ethnic backgrounds. For example, S80N/H94Y, Q249E, W802* were detected in Caucasians, Taiwanese and African-Americans, respectively. The results point out not only the difference between lung cancer and other cancers, but also genetic polymorphism among different races in the same cancer. Interestingly, there is a large disparity between African-American and other ethnic populations with lung cancer [30]. We have previously shown that there was a low frequency of EGFR and MET mutation in African-Americans as compared with Taiwanese and Caucasians [31]. In this study, the number of African-American samples analyzed was relatively fewer and we found 3 mutations that are unique to this ethnicity. It would now behoove us to further study the genetic alterations that can occur and determine the targeted therapeutics for African-Americans. Our results provide evidence of the importance of c-CBL in tumorigenesis and potential signaling. Our prediction, based on the AML data, would be that the V391I RING finger domain mutation would affect the E3 activity. Also, it will be important to determine the binding partners for c-CBL in the TKB domain and proline rich domain mutations. It has previously been shown that the TKB domain can bind to growth factor receptors and it will be important to determine the cross-binding of these mutants to MET and or EGFR. It would also be important in the future to look at fluorescence in situ hybridization/copy number changes in c-CBL in lung cancer.  c-CBL plays an important role in down regulating RTK-mediated signaling through K63 poly-ubiquitination and subsequent downregulation of RTKs followed by lysosomal degredation [3]. Mono-ubiquitination or ubiquitinated with K63-linked chains of substrates by c-CBL may lead to enhancement of biological and biochemical functions (reviewed in Hermann et al, 2007 [32]). The mutations that we analyzed in our studies all point out to the fact that the E3 activity of c-CBL on EGFR is intact; the EGFR levels in the various mutants remain same (Figure S2). Multiple kinases, both RTKs and non-RTKs could be acted upon by c-CBL, including ERBs, PDGFR, FMS, MET, c-Kit, VEGFR, FLT-1, RON, FGFR, IR, as well as SYK, FYN, LCK, FGR, LYN and c-ABL [3]. In lung cancers the relevant substrates of c-CBL in terms of degradation or signal transduction are yet to be identified.  The observation that c-CBL somatic mutations, especially S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* showed increased cell viability and cell motility that is in agreement with the physiological role for D-cbl in the regulation of apoptosis and differentiation identified in Drosophila is very significant [33]. It has been previously shown that activating c-CBL mutation downregulates EGFR signaling and decreases cellular proliferation and migration in breast cancer cell lines [34]. Although the role of c-CBL in the negative regulation of RTKs is well substantiated, thereby suggesting that it is a natural tumor suppressor, studies in cancer cells have revealed both tumor suppressor and tumor promoting activities depending on the type of c-CBL mutation and the number of alleles at the c-CBL locus [24]. In agreement with the above, the three c-CBL mutants described here appear to have tumor growth and metastasis promoting properties. Although these mutants are outside of the RING finger or the linker region of c-CBL, their downstream effects are significant so as to cause increased proliferation and migration, but the substrate affected by these mutations are not known yet. This raises the possibility that some of the cellular functions of c-CBL are independent of its ubiquitin-ligase activity, an area that we are currently investigating. The oncogenic nature of RTKs, addiction of cancers to growth signals and given the clustering of c-CBL, EGFR and MET mutations, it is possible that the transforming effect of c-CBL mutations is most likely a combinatorial effect of the three. We also show that LOH for c-CBL was found in a significant number of samples that harbored MET or EGFR mutations. The fact that about 7% of lung tumor samples are likely to have c-CBL mutations and an additional 22% are likely to harbor c-CBL-related LOH, makes c-CBL a highly mutated molecule in lung cancer. Since LOH alone is not enough to cause a transforming event [35], [36], [37], associated mutation in the MET or EGFR locus or yet another RTK discussed above may play a role in carcinogenesis. We predict that this LOH in c-CBL results in haploinsufficiency that downplays RTK ubiquitination leading to hyperactivity of the RTKs. However, whether this is sufficient cause for tumorigenesis remains to be determined. Consistent with our hypothesis is the fact that c-cbl-/- mice have increased kinase activity in lymphocytes, but is not sufficient for tumor formation [35], [36], [37]. c-CBL LOH could also lead to increased expression of c-CBL from the other allele to compensate for a loss of an allele. Alternately, there could be some form of synergy working with reduced c-CBL levels and mutated receptors that exacerbate the phenotype of each alone.  Previous studies from our lab and others have shown that East Asians with lung cancers have relatively high frequencies of gain-of-function of mutations in RTKs such as EGFR and MET [31]. In a cohort of Japanese patients an activating MET mutation was identified in the splice region that deletes the juxtamembrane domain that is involved E3 activity of c-CBL [38]. This study also found that activation of MET is mutually exclusive of EGFR, KRAS and HER2 gene mutations [38]. We failed to detect such mutations in significant numbers in lung tumor samples obtained from African-Americans (nâ€Š=â€Š29) and Caucasian (nâ€Š=â€Š50) patients. One MET mutation was identified in each of the groups whereas 1 and 3 EGFR mutations were identified in the African-American and Caucasian cohorts respectively. EGFR mutations have earlier been identified as one of the key mutations affecting lung adenocarcinoma patients in a comprehensive study of 188 patients [39]. Our study encompasses different histologies of NSCLC. However, the published series did not find any mutations in c-CBL or MET unlike our study that encompassed different subtypes of NSCLC. It is important to note, we have recently shown that MET mutations in lung cancer are in majority germline [31]. We have reported earlier c-CBL mutations in a small cohort of Taiwanese lung cancer samples [40]. In our efforts to understand the ethnic differences in the lung oncogenome, we also looked at PAX transcription factors such as PAX5 and PAX8 that are highly expressed in lung cancers; however there was no preferential expression or mutations of the above genes in lung tumor samples of African-Americans. In this study, we show relatively high frequency of c-CBL mutations in lung cancers, especially in the large cell type among Caucasians and particularly among African-Americans. We therefore propose c-CBL as an efficacious target for lung cancers in African-Americans that needs to be further substantiated. This is all the more important because the prognosis for African-Americans with lung cancer, especially for men is much poorer compared to their Caucasian counterparts [41].  In conclusion, the results presented in this study demonstrate that c-CBL is frequently mutated or even lost in lung cancers. Our results support a role for c-CBL mutants that are independent of its ubiquitination activity. Given the relatively high mutation rates in c-CBL as well as RTKs such as MET and EGFR, it is likely that their combined effect could be synergistic in promoting tumorigenesis.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Abstract Background  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a heterogeneous group of disorders with a number of genetic and proteomic alterations. c-CBL is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and adaptor molecule important in normal homeostasis and cancer. We determined the genetic variations of c-CBL, relationship to receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR and MET), and functionality in NSCLC.  Methods and Findings  Using archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) extracted genomic DNA, we show that c-CBL mutations occur in somatic fashion for lung cancers. c-CBL mutations were not mutually exclusive of MET or EGFR mutations; however they were independent of p53 and KRAS mutations. In normal/tumor pairwise analysis, there was significant loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for the c-CBL locus (22%, nâ€Š=â€Š8/37) and none of these samples revealed any mutation in the remaining copy of c-CBL. The c-CBL LOH also positively correlated with EGFR and MET mutations observed in the same samples. Using select c-CBL somatic mutations such as S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* (obtained from Caucasian, Taiwanese and African-American samples, respectively) transfected in NSCLC cell lines, there was increased cell viability and cell motility.  Conclusions  Taking the overall mutation rate of c-CBL to be a combination as somatic missense mutation and LOH, it is clear that c-CBL is highly mutated in lung cancers and may play an essential role in lung tumorigenesis and metastasis.  Go to: Introduction In the US alone, each year approximately 219,400 people are diagnosed with lung cancers, out of which more than 145,000 of them succumb to the disease [1]. This number is roughly equivalent to the combined mortality rates of cancers of the breast, prostate, colon, liver, kidney and melanoma [1]. In addition the prognosis is usually poor and the five-year survival rate is less than 15%. There are also significant ethnic differences for lung cancer, and the outcome is worse for blacks compared to whites. Gender differences are also striking with women having significantly better prognosis as compared to men. There are a number of genetic alterations that can occur in lung cancer. As an example, in NSCLC, mutations in KRAS, p53, EGFR and MET have been identified. Many of these pathways, especially Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) are controlled by c-CBL.  CBL (Casitas B-lineage lymphoma) is a mammalian gene located on human chromosome 11q23.3 [2] and is involved in cell signaling and protein ubiquitination [3]. CBL proteins belong to the RING finger class of ubiquitin ligases (E3) and there are three homologues c-CBL, CBL-b, CBL-3 [4]. The c-CBL and CBL-b genes are ubiquitously expressed with the highest levels in hematopoietic tissues [5]. c-CBL consists of four regions encoding for functionally distinct protein domains: the N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain, the linker region, the catalytic RING finger domain, the proline-rich region and the c-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain that also overlaps with a leucine-zipper (LZ) domain [3]. Both TKB and RING finger domains are essential for ligand-induced ubiquitination of RTKs [6], [7], [8], [9]. The RING finger domain is required for the recruitment of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. The TKB domain includes four-helix bundle (4H), a calcium-biding EF hand, and a modified SH2 domain, which binds to phosphotyrosine residues [3], [10], [11], [12]. In addition, the proline-rich region of c-CBL can associate with the SH3 domain of Grb2, which can indirectly recruit c-CBL to RTKs via the GRB2 adaptor protein [7], [13], [14].  c-CBL also binds to EGFR and acts as the E3 that targets EGFR for ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, CBL desensitizes EGF signaling and opposes cellular proliferation induced by EGF [15]. EGF activation also appears to activate the tyrosine kinase SRC, which phosphorylates c-CBL and in turn activates the ubiquitination and degradation of EGFR [16], [17], [18]. A recent study shows that defective endocytosis of EGFR is characterized by a deletion mutant and the point mutation L858R, whereby its association with c-CBL and subsequent ubiquitination are impaired [19]. Recently, the first human c-CBL mutations were reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients [20]. The mutation R420Q inhibits FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitination [20].  Not only can E3 activity be important in oncogenesis, c-CBL has a dual but separate function as a signal transduction molecule. We have previously shown that c-CBL is important in binding CRKL and BCR/ABL in hematopoietic cells. Also, it can bind and modulate functions of cytoskeleton by binding to proteins like talin and paxillin. The TKB domain is important in binding to a number of molecules, and they then function in signal transduction.  Given the critical role of CBL in normal homeostasis and cancer, we hypothesized that it might be mutated in lung cancers. In this study, we report novel c-CBL somatic mutations S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* in Caucasian, Taiwanese and African-American lung cancer patients, respectively. Expressing these mutations in NSCLC cell lines lead to increased proliferation and cell motility. We show that c-CBL mutations occur with or without MET or EGFR mutations but are mutually exclusive of a LOH at the c-CBL locus. Additionally, c-CBL LOH is associated with either MET or EGFR mutations. We thus hypothesize that c-CBL mutations might contribute to the oncogenic potential of MET and EGFR in lung cancer.  Go to: Methods Ethics Statement  Written consent on all research on human subjects has been obtained from the Institutional Review Board, University of Chicago and covers all research performed in the laboratory. The following is their contact information: Institutional Review Board, The University of Chicago, McGiffert Hall, 5751 S. Woodlawn Ave., 2nd floor, Chicago, IL 60637. Written informed consents were received from all patients whose tissue samples were used for this study.  Tissue Samples  Lung cancer tissue and paired adjacent normal lung tissues were obtained from 50 Caucasian, 29 African-Americans and 40 Taiwanese NSCLC patients who were recruited at the University of Chicago Hospital (Chicago, USA) (Caucasian and African-American patients) and Taipei Veterans General Hospital of Taiwan (Taiwanese patients) after obtaining appropriate Institutional Review Board permission and informed consent from the patients. Out of 119 samples, 77 were men, 38 were women and 4 were unknown with age at diagnosis ranging from 47 to 90 years. In terms of tumor types, 53 were adenocarcinoma, 32 were squamous cell carcinoma and 34 were large cell carcinoma. 49 were stage I, 14 were stage II, 34 were stage III, and 13 were stage IV (Table S1).  Cell Culture  Human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells A549 and H358 were maintained in DMEM and RPMI-1640, respectively. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in DMEM. Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 Âµg/ml of streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were cultured at 37Â°C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.  c-CBL Gene Mutational Analysis  Exons 2 to 16 of c-CBL gene were individually amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers are listed in Table S2. PCR conditions were 1 cycle of 95Â°C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles of 94Â°C for 30 seconds, 58Â°C for 30 seconds and 72Â°C for 2 minutes; and one cycle of 72Â°C for 10 minutes. PCR products were treated with ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH) and sequenced by Big-Dye Terminator Chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequencing was performed on the forward coding strand with confirmation of c-CBL alterations performed by sequencing the reverse strand as well. Chromatograms were analyzed for mutations using Mutation Surveyor v2.61 (Softgenetics, State College, PA).  Plasmid Constructs and Site-Directed Mutagenesis  The wild-type c-CBL cDNA insert was subcloned into the pAlterMax expression vector using XhoI and SalI restriction enzyme sites (Promega, Madison, WI). Using this parental plasmid pAlterMax-c-CBL, the TKB domain double mutation (S80N/H94Y), the point mutation (Q249E), and the C-terminal point mutation W802* of c-CBL were created using the following primers: 5â€²-GCTGGCGCTAAAGAATAACCCACCTTATATCTTAGAC-3â€² and 5â€²-CTACCAGATACCTACCAGTATCTCCGTACTATCTTGTC-3â€² for the double mutation S80N/H94Y; 5â€²-CTTTACCCGACTCTTTGAGCCCTGGTCCTCTTTGC-3â€² for Q249E, and 5â€²-CAGCTCCTCCTTTGGCTGATTGTCTCTGGATGGTGATC-3â€² for W802* along with their complementary primers using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis XL kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The constructs were confirmed for the point mutations by standard DNA sequencing of both strands.  Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) Analysis  Five microsatellites on chromosome 11 (3 on 11q at or within 200 kb up or downstream of the c-CBL gene and 2 control markers on 11p) were selected for analysis (Table S3). Established microsatellite markers and respective primer sequences were selected from the GeneLoc database (http://genecards.weizmann.ac.il/geneloc/index.shtml, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel). Primers were custom designed and each forward primer was fluorescently labeled at the 5â€² end with FAM, PET, NED, or VIC (Applied Biosystems). Primer annealing temperatures and duplex scores were evaluated with NIST Primer Tools (http://yellow.nist.gov:8444/dnaAnalysis/primerToolsPage.do; National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD). Primers were verified by performing PCR with control DNA (isolated from TK6 cells) and resolving the products on agarose gels. Bands were visualized with an UV transilluminator. Genomic DNA was extracted from tumor samples and paired normal lung tissue. Primers were grouped into multiplex combinations shown in Table S4. Marker D11S929 served as an internal control to check for consistency in PCRs and of peaks from capillary electrophoresis. Multiplex PCRs were carried out in a volume of 10 ÂµL that contained 1 ÂµL genomic DNA (20â€“50 ng), 0.5 ÂµM of each primer (1.0 ÂµM total for each primer pair), 400 ÂµM dNTPs, 1X PCR buffer containing MgCl2, and 0.2 U Taq DNA polymerase. PCR was performed on the ABI GeneAmp 9700 PCR System under the following conditions: 5 min at 94Â°C; 30 cycles of 30 sec at 94Â°C, 1 min at 60Â°C, 1 min at 72Â°C; and 5 min at 72Â°C. The PCR products were separated by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI 3130XL DNA Analyzer. Chromatograms were analyzed with Peak Scanner 1.0 and GeneMapper 3.7 software (Applied Biosystems) for allelic alterations. The area of the peaks produced by the DNA PCR products was quantified for each allele. The ratio of the allelic areas was calculated for each tumor and paired normal DNA sample. When the qLOH (allelic ratio for the tumor peaks divided by the allelic ratio of paired normal sample) was â‰¤0.5 or â‰¥2.0 for c-CBL and at least one other 11q marker in at least two separate experiments, the sample was considered as having an allelic imbalance and interpreted as LOH. Samples were evaluated in at least two separate experiments and samples showing prospective LOH at c-CBL repeated a third time which included a new control marker at the BAX locus (data not shown) on chromosome 19 to verify integrity of sample DNA.  Transfection of c-Cbl Constructs  The A549 cell line was transfected using the Fugene HD (Roche, Nutley, NJ) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eight Âµg of plasmid DNA, containing either no insert (empty vector), wild-type c-CBL, S80N/H94Y c-CBL, Q249E c-CBL or W802* CBL was used for transfection in a 6-well culture plate. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and analyzed for expression.  c-CBL Knockdown  c-CBL knockdown was performed using lentiviral transduction using MISSION lentiviral transduction particles (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as per manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1Ã—105 H358 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates and infected the following day with c-CBL lentiviral shRNA constructs. To generate stable c-CBL knockdown cell lines, cells were selected for 2 days with 1 Âµg/ml puromycin. c-CBL levels were determined using whole cell lysates by immunoblotting with anti-CBL antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA).  Cell Viability Assay  Cells were transfected as described above in the transfection assay. Forty-eight hours after transfection, viability of cells was assessed using Trypan Blue exclusion.  Wound Healing Assay  A549 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured for 48 h until 100% confluent. The medium was then changed and the cells were transfected as described in the transfection assay. Twelve hours after transfection, a straight scratch was made across the cell layer using a 1 ml pipette tip. The cells were then gently washed with 1Ã— PBS to remove cellular debris and the media was replaced. Photographs were taken of the wound region every 12 h until 48 h.  Western Blot Analysis  Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were collected and washed twice in 1X PBS, then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5M Tris-HCl with pH 7.4, 1.5 M NaCl, 2.5% deoxycholic acid, 10 mM EDTA, 10% NP-40, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 Âµg/mL leupeptin, and 10 Âµg/mL aprotinin) for 5 minutes. The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4Â°C, and protein content of the supernatant was measured. Total cell lysates (50 Âµg/well) were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and the gels transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman, Piscataway, NJ). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing Tween-20 (PBST) (1X PBS, 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody at 4Â°C overnight. Membranes then were washed three times with PBST and probed with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were again washed three times in PBST and bands were visualized using Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (BioRad, Valencia, CA) on a Chemidoc Gel documentation system (BioRad, Valencia, CA). Antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies and used at the following dilutions (c-CBL, 1âˆ¶5000; c-MET, 1âˆ¶5000; EGFR, 1âˆ¶5000; ubiquitin, 1âˆ¶1000; HA, 1âˆ¶5000 and Î²-actin, 1âˆ¶10,000).  Flow Cytometry  Cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow cytometry. Approximately 2Ã—106 cells were grown in media containing 10% FBS. Cells were harvested by trypsin/EDTA treatment, washed with 1X PBS three times and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 2 h. Cells were washed again with cold PBS and stained with a solution containing 25 Âµg/mL propidium iodide, 200 Âµg/mL RNase A, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes in the dark. Cell cycle analysis was performed using a Guava PCA-96 flow cytometer (Guava Technologies, Millipore, Billerica, MA).  Ubiquitin Ligase Activity  293T cells were maintained in culture in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin (100 units/mL) and streptomycin (100 Âµg/mL) were transfected with 0.2 Âµg EGFR-pcDNA3 and 2 Âµg HA-tagged c-CBL constructs as indicated using calcium phosphate according to manufacturer's protocol (Profection, Promega, Madison, WI). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were starved overnight in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS, and then treated with or without EGF (100 ng/ml) for 15 min. The cells were collected and washed two times in ice-cold PBS containing 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X100, 10% Glycerol, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors). Lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 10 min at 4Â°C. EGFR immunoprecipitations were performed on 200 Âµg of cleared lysate using 250 ng of rabbit-anti-EGFR and Protein A/G Plus Sepharose overnight at 4Â°C. Precipitations were washed 5 times in lysis buffer before boiling in Laemmli buffer. Elutions were immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin and EGFR. Twenty micrograms of cleared lysate were immunoblotted for each of the c-CBL constructs using anti-HA.  Statistical Analysis  Mutation rates between different groups were compared using Fisher's exact test. For continuous variables, group comparisons were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Sidak's adjustment for multiple comparisons. Experiments involving repeated measurements over time were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with the Greenhouse-Geisser adjustment to the degrees of freedom. Analyses were conducted using STATA (v10.1) software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).  Go to: Results c-CBL Gene Mutations in Lung Cancer  To investigate the role of c-CBL in lung cancer, we analyzed its genomic DNA in tumor and paired normal samples drawn from multiple ethnicities. The lung tumor samples represented Caucasians (nâ€Š=â€Š50), African-Americans (nâ€Š=â€Š29), and Taiwanese (nâ€Š=â€Š40) lung cancer patients. We designed 12 pairs of primers to sequence the coding region of c-CBL gene that spans exons 2 to 16 (Table S2). We identified 8 unique somatic mutations in c-CBL exons among 8 different patients. A variation L620F, a known SNP (rs2227988) in exon 11 was also detected. Importantly, the eight novel non-synonymous mutations were confirmed by sequencing both strands of c-CBL genomic DNA obtained from lung tumor samples (Table 1). Moreover, none of the 8 mutations were detected in the corresponding normal tissue, indicating that these were somatic mutations. Four synonymous single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were also identified but were not used further in this study.  Table 1 Table 1 c-CBL mutation analysis in 119 lung cancer patient tumor tissues. Three of the 8 novel non-synonymous mutations were located in the TKB (tyrosine kinase binding) domain (S80N, H94Y, and Q249E), one in the RING finger domain (V391I), one in the proline-rich region (72515_72517 del ATG), and three in the C-terminal region (W802*, R830K, and A848T) of the c-CBL protein (Figure 1A and Figure S1). In Figure 1B, we show model chromatograms of representative samples.  Figure 1 Figure 1 c-CBL mutations and LOH in non-small cell lung cancer. 11q LOH of c-CBL Gene  Paired lung tumor and normal lung tissue samples from Taiwanese patients (nâ€Š=â€Š37) were investigated for LOH. Eight (21.6%) showed LOH at the c-CBL locus on chromosome 11 while 29 samples (78.4%) revealed normal allelic contribution at the microsatellite markers (Figures 1C and D).  c-CBL Mutations in Different Ethnic Groups  The c-CBL double mutant S80N/H94Y was found in the same patient and the overall mutation rate for c-CBL in lung tumors was 6.7% (8/119). The frequency of c-CBL mutation was highest in large cell carcinoma (14.7%; 5 of 34 patients) followed by squamous carcinoma (6.3%; 2 of 32 patients) and the least was observed in adenocarcinoma (AD) (1.8%; 1 of 53 patients), although these rates were not statistically significant (pâ€Š=â€Š0.292). Mutation rates were 6.0% among Caucasians (0 of 20 in AD; 0 of 10 in SQ; and 3 of 20 in LC), 13.8% in African-Americans (1 of 10 in AD; 1 of 10 in SQ; and 2 of 9 in LC), and 2.5% (0 of 23 in AD; 1 of 12 in SQ; and 0 of 5 in LC) in the Taiwanese population. Additionally two Taiwanese patients with lung cancer (one squamous and one adenocarcinoma) had the known SNP L620F. Ethnic differences were not statistically significant, however the power to detect differences was low.  Mutations in MET and EGFR Can Be Co-Associated with c-CBL Alterations  Since East Asians with lung cancer have a higher frequency of EGFR and MET mutations in lung tumors [21], [22], we also determined mutations in EGFR and MET in the same Taiwanese cohort samples and compared the results with the observed c-CBL alterations (LOH and/or mutations). In the 37 samples tested, we did not find any overlap between c-CBL mutations and c-CBL LOH (Figure 2). Of the three c-CBL mutants (including the known L620F SNP, rs2227988), one of the samples had a MET mutation (N375S) and the other had an EGFR mutation (L858R). Among the 8 samples that had a LOH at the c-CBL locus 5 had an additional mutation in MET (N375S) and 2 had an EGFR exon 19 deletion. Twenty-six samples had neither c-CBL mutation nor c-CBL LOH (3 patients had a c-CBL mutation but no c-CBL LOH). Among these 26 samples 9 had a MET mutation (8 N375S, 1 L211W), 13 had an EGFR mutation (7 exon 9 deletion, 6 L858R) and 4 had no other MET or EGFR mutation. Thus the rate of MET or EGFR mutations among patients with LOH at the c-CBL locus (7 of 8) was similar to that seen in patients without c-CBL mutation or LOH (22 of 26 patients) (pâ€Š=â€Š0.99). These 4 patients with no identifiable mutation in c-CBL, MET or EGFR represented 10.8% of the 37 patients analyzed in the Taiwanese patient cohort. Conversely, 89.2% Taiwanese lung cancer patients have an identifiable mutation in either c-CBL, MET or EGFR or a combination of the three genes (Figure 2). Additionally, we determined p53 and KRAS mutations in these Taiwanese cohorts. Two p53 and 1 KRAS mutation were detected. The single KRAS mutation overlapped with one p53 mutation. This patient also had the EGFR exon 19 deletion but had no c-CBL mutation. The other p53 mutation sample had a c-CBL LOH with concurrent MET N375S mutation. Thus, in the Taiwanese samples analyzed, p53/KRAS mutations and c-CBL mutations were mutually exclusive (data not shown).  Figure 2 Figure 2 c-CBL mutations and relationship to MET and EGFR mutations in lung cancer. Cellular Functions of c-CBL Alterations in the Context of Lung Tumorigenesis  A. E3 activity is intact in the mutant c-CBL proteins To investigate whether the different c-CBL mutations affect the E3 activity, EGFR was chosen as a model substrate for c-CBL E3 function. All of the c-CBL mutants tested enhanced ubiquitination of the activated EGFR similar to the wild-type c-CBL protein. This result demonstrates that the catalytic activity of the c-CBL mutants is not impaired when EGFR was the substrate. (Figure 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Ubiquitination, viability, expression and cell cycle analysis of various c-CBL mutants. B. Effect on lung cancer cell viability The effect of a representative c-CBL mutant from each of the three ethnic backgrounds on lung cancer cell viability in cell lines was determined. S80N/H94Y double mutation, Q249E, and W802* were identified in lung tumor samples obtained from a Caucasian, a Taiwanese and an African-American, respectively. As described in methods, the c-CBL wild-type (WT) and the above three mutants were expressed after cloning them into pAlterMax vector in A549 cells. These cells express relatively low basal levels of endogenous c-CBL (data not shown). Transfection efficiency was comparable between different groups and the number of cells transfected with c-CBL wild-type construct was about 70% compared to control cells that were transfected with the empty vector. Cells transfected with S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* c-CBL mutant constructs resulted in increased number of viable cells that was 132.3%, 120.8% and 147.9% higher respectively, relative to the empty vector control transfected cells and significantly different from the wild-type construct (pâ€Š=â€Š0.022, pâ€Š=â€Š0.049, and pâ€Š=â€Š0.008, respectively) (Figure 3B). Relative levels of c-CBL protein in whole cell lysates prepared from samples obtained from a parallel experiment was determined. The c-CBL protein levels in samples representing untransfected and empty vector transfected cells were comparable and those representing the c-CBL WT and the three c-CBL mutants were comparable (Figure 3C).  C. Effect on cell cycle To investigate if the increases in cell viability in different c-CBL mutants are due to increased cellular proliferation, a cell cycle analysis was performed. A549 cells were transfected with the c-CBL WT or the three different mutants: S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802*. The empty vector transfectant was used as a control. Forty-eight hours after transfection cell cycle analysis was performed as described in materials and methods. There was no significant change in the subG1, G1 or the S phase of the cell cycle among the different mutants compared to the WT construct (pâ€Š=â€Š0.64, pâ€Š=â€Š0.40, and pâ€Š=â€Š0.28, respectively). The G2/M phase of the cell cycle showed an increase in cell numbers for the three mutants, S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802*, when compared to the WT but again the difference was not statistically significant (pâ€Š=â€Š0.25) (Figure 3D).  D. Effect on cell motility To investigate the effect of the expression of the above three c-CBL mutants on cell migration, we carried out wound healing assay as described in materials and methods. The closing of the scratch or the wound was monitored at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. (Figure 4A). In all the samples, that represented cells transfected with mutants, the wound gap was much smaller than that seen in the sample that represented cells transfected with c-CBL WT (p&lt;0.001). We also determined the rate of wound closure for all the five groups. At 48 h, wild-type c-CBL transfectants showed 61.1% open wound while the S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* mutants showed 18.7%, 23.9% and 34.3% open wound respectively (p&lt;0.001) (Figure 4B).  Figure 4 Figure 4 c-CBL mutations affect wound healing in A549 cells. E. c-CBL knockdown increases cell viability It is hypothesized that the LOH seen in our samples could lead to decreased expression of c-CBL. Thus we tested the effect of c-CBL knockdown in lung cancer cells. Compared to A549, H358 lung cancer cells express relatively high levels of endogenous c-CBL (data not shown). c-CBL expression was knocked down using lentiviral construct that expressed c-CBL specific shRNA and compared the results with those that were transduced with scrambled shRNA and the results are shown in Figure 5. We identified several clones that revealed varying degrees of c-CBL knockdown showing different sets of c-CBL lentiviral shRNA knockdown efficiency (Figure 5A). Of all the clones tested, Clone 27 was chosen for further experiments. Equal amount of cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and the cell proliferation was measured at various times and the results are depicted in Figure 5B. As expected, number of cells increased in a time dependent fashion from 100 to 190% relative to scrambled shRNA as control in a span of 48 h (pâ€Š=â€Š0.0002) (Figure 5B). The cell cycle phases in H358 cells that were knocked down with c-CBL shRNA were looked at and compared with the scrambled shRNA. There were no discernable differences between these two constructs in the different phases of the cell cycle (data not shown).  Figure 5 Figure 5 Knockdown of c-CBL using an shRNA increases cell proliferation. Go to: Discussion Our results demonstrate that c-CBL is somatically mutated (or has LOH) in lung cancers, and can significantly contribute to enhanced cell viability and motility. There was also a high prevalence of LOH with respect to c-CBL in lung tumors that harbored MET or EGFR mutation.  In the present study, we have demonstrated the occurrence of c-CBL mutations in lung cancer patients, especially with different ancestral variations. Mutations in c-CBL have been recently reported in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and myeloid malignancies. In the AML study, the mutation R420Q located in the junction of the RING finger and the linker region inhibited FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitination [20], thus contributing to the gain-in-function for the RTK. In addition, mutations such as H398Y, C384R, and L380P mapped to the RING finger domain and the linker region of c-CBL that is required for its E3 activity [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. Additionally, homozygous mutations in the RING finger domain of the c-CBL gene were described as a result of acquired Uniparental Disomy (UPD) [26]. It is important to note that our results indicate LOH at 11q23 locus and these are mutually exclusive from missense mutations of c-CBL. The somatic mutations were all heterozygous. The mutations in AML led to abrogation of the E3 activity leading to prolonged RTK activation. In addition mutants located on the linker region surrounding the RING finger domain exhibited enhanced AKT signaling in response to cytokine stimulation [26]. In addition, it was shown in NH3T3 cells, that neither mutations in the RING finger nor the linker region causes transformation, however while certain mutations perturbs the ubiquitination, others affect receptor recycling and prolong kinase activity [28].  We report here c-CBL mutations that mapped not only to the RING finger domain, but also to the TKB domain, proline-rich domain and the C-terminal region, but none mapped to the linker region as reported in the AML studies described above [23], [24], [25], [26], [29]. In addition, 8 mutants that we detected were found in different ethnic backgrounds. For example, S80N/H94Y, Q249E, W802* were detected in Caucasians, Taiwanese and African-Americans, respectively. The results point out not only the difference between lung cancer and other cancers, but also genetic polymorphism among different races in the same cancer. Interestingly, there is a large disparity between African-American and other ethnic populations with lung cancer [30]. We have previously shown that there was a low frequency of EGFR and MET mutation in African-Americans as compared with Taiwanese and Caucasians [31]. In this study, the number of African-American samples analyzed was relatively fewer and we found 3 mutations that are unique to this ethnicity. It would now behoove us to further study the genetic alterations that can occur and determine the targeted therapeutics for African-Americans. Our results provide evidence of the importance of c-CBL in tumorigenesis and potential signaling. Our prediction, based on the AML data, would be that the V391I RING finger domain mutation would affect the E3 activity. Also, it will be important to determine the binding partners for c-CBL in the TKB domain and proline rich domain mutations. It has previously been shown that the TKB domain can bind to growth factor receptors and it will be important to determine the cross-binding of these mutants to MET and or EGFR. It would also be important in the future to look at fluorescence in situ hybridization/copy number changes in c-CBL in lung cancer.  c-CBL plays an important role in down regulating RTK-mediated signaling through K63 poly-ubiquitination and subsequent downregulation of RTKs followed by lysosomal degredation [3]. Mono-ubiquitination or ubiquitinated with K63-linked chains of substrates by c-CBL may lead to enhancement of biological and biochemical functions (reviewed in Hermann et al, 2007 [32]). The mutations that we analyzed in our studies all point out to the fact that the E3 activity of c-CBL on EGFR is intact; the EGFR levels in the various mutants remain same (Figure S2). Multiple kinases, both RTKs and non-RTKs could be acted upon by c-CBL, including ERBs, PDGFR, FMS, MET, c-Kit, VEGFR, FLT-1, RON, FGFR, IR, as well as SYK, FYN, LCK, FGR, LYN and c-ABL [3]. In lung cancers the relevant substrates of c-CBL in terms of degradation or signal transduction are yet to be identified.  The observation that c-CBL somatic mutations, especially S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* showed increased cell viability and cell motility that is in agreement with the physiological role for D-cbl in the regulation of apoptosis and differentiation identified in Drosophila is very significant [33]. It has been previously shown that activating c-CBL mutation downregulates EGFR signaling and decreases cellular proliferation and migration in breast cancer cell lines [34]. Although the role of c-CBL in the negative regulation of RTKs is well substantiated, thereby suggesting that it is a natural tumor suppressor, studies in cancer cells have revealed both tumor suppressor and tumor promoting activities depending on the type of c-CBL mutation and the number of alleles at the c-CBL locus [24]. In agreement with the above, the three c-CBL mutants described here appear to have tumor growth and metastasis promoting properties. Although these mutants are outside of the RING finger or the linker region of c-CBL, their downstream effects are significant so as to cause increased proliferation and migration, but the substrate affected by these mutations are not known yet. This raises the possibility that some of the cellular functions of c-CBL are independent of its ubiquitin-ligase activity, an area that we are currently investigating. The oncogenic nature of RTKs, addiction of cancers to growth signals and given the clustering of c-CBL, EGFR and MET mutations, it is possible that the transforming effect of c-CBL mutations is most likely a combinatorial effect of the three. We also show that LOH for c-CBL was found in a significant number of samples that harbored MET or EGFR mutations. The fact that about 7% of lung tumor samples are likely to have c-CBL mutations and an additional 22% are likely to harbor c-CBL-related LOH, makes c-CBL a highly mutated molecule in lung cancer. Since LOH alone is not enough to cause a transforming event [35], [36], [37], associated mutation in the MET or EGFR locus or yet another RTK discussed above may play a role in carcinogenesis. We predict that this LOH in c-CBL results in haploinsufficiency that downplays RTK ubiquitination leading to hyperactivity of the RTKs. However, whether this is sufficient cause for tumorigenesis remains to be determined. Consistent with our hypothesis is the fact that c-cbl-/- mice have increased kinase activity in lymphocytes, but is not sufficient for tumor formation [35], [36], [37]. c-CBL LOH could also lead to increased expression of c-CBL from the other allele to compensate for a loss of an allele. Alternately, there could be some form of synergy working with reduced c-CBL levels and mutated receptors that exacerbate the phenotype of each alone.  Previous studies from our lab and others have shown that East Asians with lung cancers have relatively high frequencies of gain-of-function of mutations in RTKs such as EGFR and MET [31]. In a cohort of Japanese patients an activating MET mutation was identified in the splice region that deletes the juxtamembrane domain that is involved E3 activity of c-CBL [38]. This study also found that activation of MET is mutually exclusive of EGFR, KRAS and HER2 gene mutations [38]. We failed to detect such mutations in significant numbers in lung tumor samples obtained from African-Americans (nâ€Š=â€Š29) and Caucasian (nâ€Š=â€Š50) patients. One MET mutation was identified in each of the groups whereas 1 and 3 EGFR mutations were identified in the African-American and Caucasian cohorts respectively. EGFR mutations have earlier been identified as one of the key mutations affecting lung adenocarcinoma patients in a comprehensive study of 188 patients [39]. Our study encompasses different histologies of NSCLC. However, the published series did not find any mutations in c-CBL or MET unlike our study that encompassed different subtypes of NSCLC. It is important to note, we have recently shown that MET mutations in lung cancer are in majority germline [31]. We have reported earlier c-CBL mutations in a small cohort of Taiwanese lung cancer samples [40]. In our efforts to understand the ethnic differences in the lung oncogenome, we also looked at PAX transcription factors such as PAX5 and PAX8 that are highly expressed in lung cancers; however there was no preferential expression or mutations of the above genes in lung tumor samples of African-Americans. In this study, we show relatively high frequency of c-CBL mutations in lung cancers, especially in the large cell type among Caucasians and particularly among African-Americans. We therefore propose c-CBL as an efficacious target for lung cancers in African-Americans that needs to be further substantiated. This is all the more important because the prognosis for African-Americans with lung cancer, especially for men is much poorer compared to their Caucasian counterparts [41].  In conclusion, the results presented in this study demonstrate that c-CBL is frequently mutated or even lost in lung cancers. Our results support a role for c-CBL mutants that are independent of its ubiquitination activity. Given the relatively high mutation rates in c-CBL as well as RTKs such as MET and EGFR, it is likely that their combined effect could be synergistic in promoting tumorigenesis.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Recent evidence has demonstrated that acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD) is a novel mechanism by which pathogenetic mutations in cancer may be reduced to homozygosity. To help identify novel mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), we performed a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) screen to identify aUPD in 58 patients with atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML; n = 30), JAK2 mutationâ€“negative myelofibrosis (MF; n = 18), or JAK2 mutationâ€“negative polycythemia vera (PV; n = 10). Stretches of homozygous, copy neutral SNP calls greater than 20Mb were seen in 10 (33%) aCML and 1 (6%) MF, but were absent in PV. In total, 7 different chromosomes were involved with 7q and 11q each affected in 10% of aCML cases. CBL mutations were identified in all 3 cases with 11q aUPD and analysis of 574 additional MPNs revealed a total of 27 CBL variants in 26 patients with aCML, myelofibrosis or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Most variants were missense substitutions in the RING or linker domains that abrogated CBL ubiquitin ligase activity and conferred a proliferative advantage to 32D cells overexpressing FLT3. We conclude that acquired, transforming CBL mutations are a novel and widespread pathogenetic abnormality in morphologically related, clinically aggressive MPNs.  Introduction  Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by overproliferation of one or more myeloid cell lineages in the bone marrow and increased numbers of mature and immature myeloid cells in the peripheral blood. Excess proliferation is frequently associated with splenomegaly and cardiovascular complications as well as increased risk of transformation to acute leukemia. MPNs are categorized into subtypes based on specific morphologic, hematologic, and laboratory parameters, the best characterized being the 4 so-called classic MPNs: polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis (MF), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).1 In addition, several atypical MPNs are recognized, some of which show both dysplastic and proliferative features, such as atypical, BCR-ABL negative CML (aCML).2  MPNs are associated with acquired, activating mutations or gene fusions of tyrosine kinases, abnormalities that are believed to be critical drivers of excess proliferation as a result of deregulated or constitutive signaling.3 The 2 most prominent examples are BCR-ABL in CML4 and the V617F JAK2 mutation in PV, ET, and MF,5â‡“â‡“â€“8 but more than 40 variant tyrosine kinase fusions have been identified in MPNs as well as other mutations in JAK2 and FLT3.2 Activating mutations have been described in components that signal upstream (eg, MPL) or downstream (eg, NRAS) of tyrosine kinases9,10; however, the molecular pathogenesis of the majority of atypical MPNs and approximately 50% of ET and MF cases remains obscure.  V617F JAK2 was initially identified by several different routes, one of which was based on the observation that many PV patients show evidence of acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD) at chromosome 9p.11,12 Regions of aUPD exhibit loss of heterozygosity (LOH) compared with constitutional DNA without change of copy number and arise by mitotic recombination followed by selection for one of the products. After the initial observations in PV, it has emerged that aUPD is common in both hematologic and epithelial malignancies, and is associated with known oncogenic changes in a variety of genes within the affected regions.13 In this study we set out to determine whether aUPD characterizes MPNs of unknown molecular etiology and, if so, whether it could be used as a tool to help identify novel driver mutations.  Methods  Patients  Peripheral blood or bone marrow samples were received from patients diagnosed with an MPN or other hematologic malignancy according to standard morphologic, hematologic, and laboratory criteria. Clinical data were available from a subset of these cases. The study was approved by the Internal Review Boards from participating institutions and informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.  SNP array analysis  DNA labeling and hybridization to Affymetrix 50k XbaI chips was performed at the Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum fÃ¼r Genomforschung (RZPD, Berlin, Germany). Raw data were imported into the Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software, analyzed using Affymetrix (High Wycombe, United Kingdom) GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE 4.1) and copy number analysis tool (CNAT). Data were exported to custom-designed spreadsheets that display loss of heterozygosity and copy number changes in ideogram format. Data were also analyzed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console (version 2.1). Overall, a median of 98.2% (range, 91.5%-99.6%) of SNPs gave readable calls.  Mutation analysis  Detection of mutations by high resolution melting (HRM) analysis was performed as described14 using a Rotor-Gene 6000 (Corbett Life Sciences, St Neots, United Kingdom). Direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products was performed by standard techniques on an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, United Kingdom) and analyzed using Mutation Surveyor (SoftGenetics, State College, PA). CBL mutations are numbered relative to the ATG (A = 1) in the Ensembl cDNA sequence ENSG00000110395. A dropping factor (relative intensity drop of the wild-type allele peak relative to that seen in a concurrently run normal sample) of 60% or more was considered indicative of a biallelic mutation whereas a dropping factor of less than 60% was considered as monoallelic. Primer sequences for CBL exon 8 were CBL_i7f (5â€²-tgtggtttcactttaaaccctgga-3â€²) and CBL_i8r (5â€²-gccaggccaccccttgtatc-3â€²) and for CBL exon 9 were CBL_i8f (5â€²-ggcctggcttttgggttagg-3â€²) and CBL_i9r (5â€²-cacaatggattttgccagtctcc-3â€²). CBL reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was performed on random hexamerâ€“reverse transcribed RNA using primers CBLe7F: 5â€²-gaatcctgatctgactggcttatg-3â€² and CBLe10R 5â€²-gctgcggcagaaggtcaagt-3â€². Other primer sequences are available on request.  Microsatellite analysis  DNA samples were amplified with a series of fluorescently labeled primer pairs flanking highly polymorphic microsatellite markers on chromosome 11q as described.10 aUPD was scored if 4 or more consecutive markers encompassing CBL were homozygous without change in allelic copy number (P &lt; .05 of this occurring in the absence of aUPD based on published rates of heterozygosity). Copy number at 11q was estimated by multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) using the Marfan probeset 1 (P065; MRC Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), a kit that contains four 11q control probes including one at 11q23.3.  Constructs  pMY-wtCBL and pMY-CBLR420Q express wild-type and R420Q CBL, respectively, along with green fluorescent protein (GFP).15 Other CBL mutant constructs were derived from pMY-wtCBL using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). pAL/FLT3 and pCMVâ€“HA ubiquitin have also been described previously.15  Cell lines  The IL-3â€“dependent murine myeloid cell 32Dcl3 (32D) was purchased from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (Braunschweig, Germany) and was maintained in 90% RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% WEHI-3B conditioned medium (WEHI). All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37Â°C and 5% carbon dioxide. 32D cells were stably transduced by electroporation with wt-FLT3 in a pAL vector as previously described16 and maintained in 15 ng/mL blastocidin (Invitrogen, Paisley United Kingdom). The Platinum-E (Plat-E) retrovirus packaging cell line17 was transfected using the calcium phosphate method with 5 Î¼g CBL construct DNA: 106 32D/wtFLT3 cells were cocultivated with the Plat-E cells for 48 hours in a volume of 2 mL (50% RPMI, 50% DMEM, 10% FBS, 5% WEHI). GFP positive cells were flow sorted to highest possible purity using a BD FACSAria cell sorter (Becton Dickinson, Stanford, CA). If insufficient cells were obtained for experiments after flow sorting, the cells were maintained in culture and resorted to greater than 95% purity.  Growth factor withdrawal assays  Cell growth was compared with wt-FLT3, vector-only transfected cells and the parental 32D line in stably transfected cells. Cells (105/mL) were grown over 3 days in triplicate for each CBL mutant and a wt-CBL control in 96-well plates. Cultures were analyzed daily for proliferation using the Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (MTS assay; Promega, Southampton, United Kingdom). All experiments were performed at least 3 times independently and results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).  Ubiquitin ligase activity  The ubiquitin ligase activity of CBL mutants in comparison to wild-type CBL was determined by transiently transfecting 107 32D/wtFLT3 cells expressing wild-type or CBL mutants by electroporation with 20 Î¼g pCMV-HA ubiquitin. Cells were maintained in culture with WEHI for 12 hours after transfection before being washed, serum deprived overnight, exposed to FLT3 ligand for 10 minutes, and lysed in buffer as described.18 Lysates were incubated with a FLT3-specific polyclonal antibody overnight at 4Â°C. Protein G agarose beads (100 Î¼L) were added and incubated at 4Â°C for 4 hours. The beads were washed 4 times in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer. The supernatant was mixed with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) sample loading buffer before immunoblot analyses with antibodies against HA-ubiquitin (sc-805; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), CBL (2111C3a; Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), and FLT3 (sc-479; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA).  Results  SNP array analysis  We performed genome-wide SNP analysis on leukocyte DNA extracted from 58 MPD patients: aCML (n = 30), V617F JAK2 negative MF (n = 18), and JAK2 mutation negative PV/idiopathic erythrocytosis (n = 10). As comparators, we also analyzed cases of CML in transformation to blast crisis (n = 30, of which 20 were myeloid and 10 lymphoid) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; n = 20). We conservatively defined likely regions of aUPD as at least 20 Mb of absent or significantly reduced heterozygous SNP calls (ie, &lt; 5% SNPs called as heterozygous) running to a telomere without change in copy number (Figure 1A). Such large regions are uncommon in healthy individuals.19 Strikingly, we found that aUPD was common in aCML with 10 (33%) of cases affected. In contrast, aUPD was only seen in a single case of MF and was not seen in other patient subgroups. In total, 7 different chromosomes were affected, with abnormalities at 7q and 11q each seen recurrently in 10% of aCML cases. The affected regions ranged in size from 29 Mb to a complete copy of chromosome 13 (Table 1).

There is no gross copy number change (individual datapoints spread around the zero line), but a large block of homozygous SNP calls at 9p indicative of aUPD. The 2 panels on the right are from a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast crisis case and show LOH accompanied by a 20q deletion. (B) For case UPN 5, a large block of 11q aUPD is apparent on analysis of granulocytes but almost completely absent from mononuclear cells (MNCs) extracted from the same sample.

Two controls are shown: an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient previously known to have a heterozygous FLT3 ITD and a healthy individual. View inlineView popup Table 1 Chromosomal regions and cases affected by aUPD Association between aUPD and known acquired oncogenic mutations  Although we did not have constitutional DNA to formally confirm that the regions of homozygosity were acquired, in 1 individual we found a marked reduction in the proportion of 11q aUPD positive cells on comparison of mononuclear cells and granulocytes, consistent with an acquired abnormality (Figure 1B). Some of the affected regions harbor genes known to be relevant to hematologic malignancies and therefore we assessed their mutational status. Sequencing of the MPL gene in the case UPN 27 with 1p aUPD revealed a homozygous G&gt;T change (Figure 1C) that results in the previously reported W515L substitution.9 Case UPN 28 with whole chromosome 13 UPD had a homozygous FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD; Figure 1D). Candidate genes for the abnormalities at 17q and 21q include NF1 and RUNX1, respectively; however, these were not investigated.  11q aUPD is associated with CBL mutations  Next, we focused our analysis on the 2 recurrent regions of aUPD at 7q and 11q. Because of the strong association between MPNs and aberrant tyrosine kinase signaling, we analyzed genes encoding tyrosine kinases and associated signaling components. The minimally affected region at chromosome 7q contains 3 tyrosine kinases: MET, EPHA1, and EPHB6. We fully sequenced the coding exons of these genes in the 3 cases with 7q aUPD and 2 normal controls but found no abnormalities. Similarly, we found no sequence changes in exons 11 through 17 of BRAF, a gene encoding a downstream component of RAS signaling that is mutated in malignant melanoma and other cancers.20 There are no tyrosine kinase genes on chromosome 11q, and although there are several genes encoding signal transduction components, CBL stood out as a known oncogene that negatively regulates tyrosine kinase signaling.21 Sequencing of CBL in the three 11q aUPD cases revealed that UPN 2 and UPN 5 each had a T&gt;C change at nucleotide 1277 in exon 8 that predicts a L380P substitution. Case UPN 3 had a C&gt;G missense change in exon 9 at nucleotide 1387 that predicts a P417A change (Figure 2). Consistent with the array results, the mutations in cases UPN 3 and UPN 5 were predominant with the residual wild-type alleles only weakly visible. For case UPN 2 both the mutation and level of aUPD was less prominent, presumably due to a greater background of normal cells.

Prevalence and nature of CBL mutations  To determine the prevalence of CBL mutations, we sequenced exons 8 and 9 (that encode amino acids 366 through 409 and 410 through 477, respectively) in an additional 574 MPN cases. A total of 27 sequence variants were identified in 26 patients, of whom 3 had MF, 10 had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), 12 had aCML and 1 had hypereosinophilic syndrome/chronic eosinophilic leukemia (HES/CEL; Tables 2 and 3). To ensure that we were not missing mutations elsewhere in the gene we analyzed all coding exons in 70 CBL mutation negative aCML or unclassified, CML-like MPN cases by high resolution melt (HRM) analysis but failed to detect any further sequence changes apart from known polymorphisms. Similarly, no mutations in CBLB exons 9 or 10 or CBLC exons 7 and 8 (the exons that correspond to CBL exons 8 and 9) were identified. The activity of BCR-ABL is known to increase during progression of CML from chronic phase to blast crisis22 and we speculated that abrogation of CBL activity might be at least partially responsible for this increase. HRM analysis of CBL exons 8 and 9 in blast crisis cases (n = 31), however, failed to reveal any mutations.  View inlineView popup Table 2 Cases analyzed for CBL mutations View inlineView popup Table 3 List of CBL sequence variants Of the 27 CBL variants, 21 (78%) were missense substitutions affecting 12 amino acids (15 different substitutions), 5 (19%) were candidate splicing abnormalities, and 1 (3%) produced a stop codon (Table 3). Most of the changes were novel, although 4 cases had R420Q as previously identified in a single case of AML.15 Apart from N454D, all residues affected by missense mutations were completely conserved in CBL orthologues as well as the 2 other human CBL family members (Figure 3). The mutation to a stop codon was found in a patient (UPN 9) who also had the Y371H variant; PCR across the affected regions and sequencing indicated that the 2 changes were on different alleles.

Residues affected by missense mutations found in this study are indicated by â–¼. CBL mutations are acquired and rarely seen in conjunction with other known mutations  For 2 cases (UPN 5 and UPN 14) we were able to compare the mutational status of leukocytes and T cells or buccal epithelia cells. In both cases the L380P mutation was only present in leukocytes and was therefore acquired (Figure 4A). A third case (UPN 15) originally presented with V617F JAK2 negative ET in 1989 but progressed to MF in 2004. Analysis of DNA extracted from sequential bone marrow slides indicated that the R420Q mutation was absent at the ET phase but acquired on transformation (Figure 4B). The 3 CBL-positive MF cases tested negative for MPL 515 mutations and all CBL mutation positive cases were negative for cytogenetic indicators of tyrosine kinase fusions, FLT3 ITD, activating NRAS mutations and V617F JAK2, with the exception of 1 case (UPN 14) with MF who tested positive for both L380P CBL and V617F JAK2. Analysis of retrospective bone marrow slides for this case indicated the presence of V617F JAK2 at low level initially but absence of L380P CBL. The CBL mutation was detectable 7 years later and completely displaced V617F after a further 3 years, corresponding with a significant rise is peripheral leukocyte counts (Figure 4C). A further case (UPN 21) presented with systemic mastocytosis before evolving to CBL mutation-positive CMML but retrospective samples were unavailable.

(C) Clinical course of case UPN 14, who presented with MF in 1998 but experienced elevated leukocyte counts in 2005, concomitant with the appearance of the CBL L380P mutation. The JAK2 V617F mutation, which had been present at low level since diagnosis, was still detectable when CBL L380P first appeared but was undetectable in the 2008 sample, when the CBL mutated clone predominated (* on sequence trace). (D) RT-PCR analysis. All cases and controls show the expected product from CBL exons 7-10. Cases UPN 18 and UPN 20 show smaller bands that result from complete deletion of exon 8. Splicing abnormalities  RNA was available for 3 of the 5 cases with potential splicing mutations. Patients UPN 18 and UPN 20 both exhibited double bands by RT-PCR, sequencing of which showed one to be the normal product and the smaller band to result from the complete deletion of exon 8 in each case (Figure 4D), similar to that described in the cell line MOLM-13.23 Patient UPN 19 showed a single band by RT-PCR that was entirely normal on sequence analysis indicating that the exon 8+4 C&gt;T change does not alter splicing. It seems likely, therefore, that the variant identified in case UPN 6 is also of no consequence. The pathogenicity of the intronic variant seen in case UPN 13 remains unknown.  The association between CBL mutations and UPD  To examine the association between CBL mutations and aUPD in more detail we performed microsatellite analysis on all mutated cases using 9 polymorphic markers spanning chromosome 11q13-qter. Of the 26 cases, 11 displayed patterns that indicated significant tracts of homozygosity, including all 3 with 11q aUPD detected by SNP arrays. Case UPN 9 with 2 mutations was heterozygous for all markers. Of the 11 cases with biallelic CBL mutations as judged by sequence analysis, 5 showed complete homozygosity at all microsatellite loci tested and 6 had at least 4 consecutive homozygous calls encompassing the location of the CBL gene at 11q23.3 (Figure 5). We performed multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) analysis to determine whether the observed homozygosity was a consequence of a deletion but no copy number changes were detected (data not shown) and therefore it is likely that homozygosity arose by aUPD. The number of mutated alleles estimated by sequencing was concordant with the microsatellite analysis in 20 cases (Figure 5). Of those that were discordant, UPN 6 and UPN 25 had significant tracts of 11q homozygosity but had a monoallelic CBL mutation whereas UPN 10 and UPN 16 did not show 11q homozygosity but had clear biallelic CBL mutations. The reason for these discrepant cases is unclear, but it is possible that the aUPD seen in UPN 6 and UPN 25 targeted another gene at 11q before acquisition of the CBL mutation. Homozygosity for the CBL mutations in the absence of 11q aUPD in UPN 10 and UPN 16 might be explained by a subcytogenetic deletion of 1 allele.  Figure 5 Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Figure 5 Microsatellite analysis of CBL mutation positive cases. The number of CBL mutated alleles (1 monoallelic; 2 biallelic) was estimated by sequence analysis as described in â€œExperimental procedures.â€� Microsatellites were scored as homozygous (Embedded Image) or heterozygous (â–¡) for each case and their positions on chromosome 11q are indicated. Correlation between CBL mutations and clinical features  We compared clinical and hematologic features in patients with or without CBL mutations, restricting the analysis to cases with aCML, MF and CMML because these were the subgroups in which CBL mutations were most commonly found. Patients with CBL mutations had a shorter overall survival and progression-free survival compared with mutation negative cases (overall survival: 33 months vs 39 months; progression-free survival: 22 months vs 32 months) but the differences were not significant (Figure 6). Similarly there was no significant difference in gender distribution, age and standard hematologic parameters between mutation positive and mutation negative cases and no differences emerged when individual disease entities were considered.

Overall survival (A) and progression-free survival (B) for atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and MF cases with (n = 19) or without (n = 87) CBL mutations. The differences between mutation positive and negative cases was not significant as determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Transforming activities of CBL mutants  We determined whether selected CBL variants had oncogenic activity by testing whether they could transform the interleukin-3 (IL-3)â€“dependent cell line 32D to growth factor independence in conjunction with overexpression of wild-type FLT3, as has been described previously for R420Q.15 We found that S376F, H398Y, P417A, and R420Q alone each conferred a degree of growth factor independence to 32D cells, but this effect was considerably enhanced in 32Ds that overexpressed wild-type FLT3. In contrast, wild-type CBL conferred no growth advantage either with or without FLT3 overexpression. The N454D change was not transforming, indicating that it is probably a rare polymorphism or a pathogenetically unimportant passenger mutation (Figure 7). Reproducible differences in survival between the different mutants were seen, as illustrated in Figure 8A.  Figure 7 Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Figure 7 Transforming activity of CBL mutants. 32D cells or 32Ds overexpressing wild-type FLT3 were transfected with wild-type or mutant CBL constructs and assayed for IL-3 independent growth over 3 days.

(B) 32D cells expressing wild-type FLT3 and CBL constructs as indicated were transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin and stimulated with FLT3 ligand. After lysis, FLT3 was immunoprecipitated, blotted, and probed with anti-HA. Total blots for FLT3 AND CBL are also shown. Abrogation of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity  It has been shown that FLT3 physically associates with CBL and that, upon ligand stimulation, FLT3 is rapidly ubiquitinylated by wild-type but not R420Q CBL.15 We found that transforming activity correlated directly with the ubiquitin ligase activity of the CBL variants, as assayed by their ability to transfer HA-tagged ubiquitin to FLT3 after stimulation with FLT3 ligand. The S376F, H398Y, P417A and R420Q mutants showed loss of ubiquitin ligase activity, whereas N454D was comparable to wild-type CBL (Figure 8B).  Discussion  The initial aim of our study was to identify large regions of aUPD and therefore we undertook a relatively low resolution genome scan using 50k SNP arrays. Because we did not have constitutional DNA available from most of our cases, we were not able to unambiguously determine whether the extended blocks of homozygosity that we observed were a consequence of aUPD, constitutional UPD or autozygosity due to consaguinity, however we used a very conservative definition of candidate aUPD regions (at least 20 Mb homozygous SNPs calls running to a telomere) and therefore expected that most or all would be acquired. We found that aUPD was relatively common in aCML, but was uncommon in other MPNs that were negative for known mutations, plus also CML blast crisis and CLL. Six distinct regions of aUPD were identified in aCML, indicating substantial genetic heterogeneity in the genesis of this disorder. However, we identified 2 recurrent regions of aUPD at 7q and 11q that were each seen in 10% of cases indicating the presence of common molecular abnormalities.  Our mutation screening focused primarily on tyrosine kinases and associated signal transduction components because of the known association between deregulated tyrosine kinase signaling and MPNs.3 Although we failed thus far to identify any abnormality on chromosome 7q, we found missense CBL mutations in all three 11q aUPD cases. Screening of further MPNs revealed a total of 27 CBL variants in 26 patients who had been diagnosed with aCML (n = 12; 8%), MF (n = 3, 6%), CMML (n = 10, 13%), or HES/CEL (n = 1, 1%); that is, morphologically and clinically related diseases that generally exhibit a poor prognosis. We were unable to discern, however, any specific clinical or prognostic features specifically associated with CBL mutated cases.  Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (CBL) is a well characterized protein that plays both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling. In its positive role, CBL binds to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via its N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain and serves as an adaptor by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K. However the RING domain of CBL has E3 ligase activity and ubiquitinylates activated receptor tyrosine kinases on lysine residues, a signal that triggers internalization of the receptor/ligand complex and subsequent recycling or degradation.21,24,25 CBL was originally identified after the characterization of v-Cbl, the transforming component of the Cas NS-1 retrovirus, and thus its association with neoplasia is well established26; however, it is only very recently that CBL mutations were first identified in a human malignancy, specifically occasional cases of AML.15,23,27 We have found that CBL mutations are much more common in MPNs, and previous reports of 11q aUPD in MDS28 suggest that CBL mutations will also prove to be common in this disease. Indeed, 7 of 12 MDS cases with aUPD at 11q were recently shown to harbor CBL mutations.29 There are 2 other human CBL family members, CBLB and CBLC, but we did not identify aUPD in the regions containing these genes and did not detect any mutations of the linker/RING domain of CBLB.  We identified a total of 15 different CBL missense mutations affecting 12 residues (Table 2; Figure 3). Mutations of some of these residues (eg, Y371, C381, H398 and W408) have been analyzed previously in a study that concluded that loss of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and concomitant impairment of EGFR internalization by RING finger mutations was insufficient for oncogenicity, as assayed in NIH3T3 cells. However mutations of key residues within the Î±-helix of the linker region abolished ubiquitin ligase activity and were transforming.30 Although the precise amino acid substitutions we identified were different from those studied, we found that mutations in both the RING finger and linker regions conferred autonomous growth to 32D/wt-FLT3 cells, consistent with a causal relationship to the MPN phenotype. The fact that one mutation (N454D) was not transforming emphasizes the importance of functional analysis to distinguish driver mutations from irrelevant passengers or infrequent polymorphisms.31 Notably, this mutation was only weakly conserved between species, in contrast to all other missense mutations that affected highly conserved residues and are therefore likely to be functionally significant.  Enhanced autonomous growth in the presence of CBL mutations and overexpression of wild-type FLT3 may simply reflect the paucity of receptor tyrosine kinase gene expression in 32D cells or, alternatively, may indicate that the mutants are only weakly transforming and require the cooperation of other events to give rise to clinically manifest disease. Consistent with the latter hypothesis, we identified 2 cases in which CBL mutations were acquired during progression of a preexisting MPN (Figure 4). In both cases the identity of the cooperating change is unknown: although one presented with a (relatively low level) V617F JAK2 mutation, this disappeared on progression to CBL L380P positive disease, indicating that the 2 mutations must have arisen independently in different clones. This is reminiscent of the observation that the leukemic blasts of approximately half of V617F positive MPNs that evolve to AML are negative for the JAK2 mutation.32,33 It remains to be established, however, if CBL mutations are usually secondary events or whether the 2 cases we identified are exceptional.  Further evidence for the requirement for additional cooperating genetic events comes from published mouse studies in which neither complete CBL knockout nor heterozygous knockin of the RING finger inactivating mutant C379A (mouse C379 is equivalent to human C381) resulted in evidence of an MPN or other malignancy.34,35 However, closer analysis revealed subtle hemopoietic perturbations that clearly relate to the pathogenesis of MPNs. Specifically, hemopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from these animals were increased in number, hyperresponsive to thrombopoietin and more potent than wild-type HSCs in repopulating the hemopoietic system. These effects were associated with increased STAT5 accumulation and phosphorylation.34,35 Hyperresponsiveness to growth factors and stem cell involvement are 2 of the cardinal features of MPNs. Furthermore, the association between STAT5 activation and MPNs is well documented.36,37 While it is possible that overt hematologic disease might have been induced by a homozygous knockin mutant, these findings suggest that CBL mutations may not be solely responsible for a full MPN phenotype.  The nature of any cooperating abnormalities remains largely obscure. Our results show that overexpression of a tyrosine kinase can cooperate with CBL mutants to promote transformation, however we failed to identify any kinase that was consistently overexpressed in mutation positive cases by tyrosine kinase expression profiling (data not shown). One CBL mutation positive case, however, also tested positive for 7q UPD by SNP array, suggesting that these 2 abnormalities may complement each other. A CBL mutation resulting in skipping of exon 8 has also been identified in a murine model of NUP98-HOXD13 on progression from MDS to AML,38 further corroborating the theory that acute leukemia arises from complementary mutations, one of which inhibits differentiation, and a second (in this case CBL) that enhances proliferation or inhibits apoptosis.  The fact that many CBL mutations are associated with aUPD strongly suggests that clones with homozygous mutations have a selective advantage over those that are heterozygous. This contrasts with the prevailing view that transforming CBL RING finger and linker region mutants act in a dominant negative fashion. Although it is conceivable that another, unknown locus on 11q is the target of aUPD, the finding of 1 case with a Y371H mutation and a stop codon on opposite alleles strongly suggests that homozygous CBL mutations do indeed confer a direct selective advantage. Because we did not screen the entire gene for mutations, it is possible that other cases with heterozygous mutations may also be functionally homozygous due to premature stop codons on the other allele. Alternatively, heterozygosity in these cases may only be apparent due to variable proportions of background normal cells that are not part of the malignant clone. Although the nontransforming N454D mutant was heterozygous, 2 cases with heterozygous R420Q were observed and thus absence of homozygosity cannot be used to infer the presence of an irrelevant, nontransforming sequence variant.  In summary, we have found that oncogenic CBL mutations are acquired in a subset of hematologically related, poor prognosis MPNs. Our findings further strengthen the notion that MPNs are primarily â€œtyrosine kinopathies,â€� that is, diseases caused by aberrant activation of proliferation and survival pathways as a consequence of mutations that either directly or indirectly promote excess tyrosine kinase signaling. In view of the fact that tyrosine kinases are such good drug targets, the possibility that CBL-mutated cases might be amenable to therapeutic inhibition is clearly attractive.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Oncogenic mutations in the monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors, but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study, we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability, binding, and activity. We found that recurrent, homozygous, and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2, by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and, to a lesser extent, with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding, whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity, and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL, driver mutations, protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations), the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability, interactions, and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures, their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2, 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity, stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5, 6). Strikingly, proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain (TKBD), a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain, while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time, since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain, they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9, 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK, CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein, thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study, substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach, which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability, binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely, we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent, homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.  Go to: Materials and Methods Computational modeling and analysis  Mapping of CBL mutations The COSMIC database (15) stores data on somatic cancer mutations and integrates the experimental data from full-genome sequencing studies. We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations), zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations), types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition, all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a â€œRandomâ€� missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures, we obtained 2,102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL), (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S), (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13), CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%, the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Ã…. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Ã… from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40,000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  Î”Gbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î”Gbindmut-Î”GbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î±Î”Î”Evdw+Î²Î”Î”Gsolv+Î³Î”SAmut+ÎµÎ”Î”GBM+Î»Î”Î”GFD+Î´ (3) Here Î”Î”Evdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and Î”Î”Gsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. Î”SAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. Î”Î”GBM and Î”Î”GFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX, respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation, optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( Î”Gfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( Î”GfoldWT).  Î”Î”Gfold=Î”Gfoldmut-Î”GfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27), the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). (See Supplementary Methods for more information.)  Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs, described above, were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T, the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega, Madison, WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15, A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15, and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp., Madison, WI), incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change, and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins, cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbeccoâ€™s PBS-containing 200 Î¼M sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals, Fairlawn, NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO], 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors [Complete tabsÂ®, Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16,000 Ã— g for 15 m at 4 Â°C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA). For immunoblotting, 20Î¼g of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue, 0.3573 M Î²-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations, 150 Î¼g of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer, then resuspended in 2X loading buffer, boiled for 5 m, then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman, Sanford, MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins, the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling), rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase, (clone 3F10; Roche), rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc., South Plainfield, NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc., Long Beach, CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination, in the presence of each CBL mutation, was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes, Î”Î”Gfold, upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35, 36). Namely, the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal molâˆ’1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations, recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value â‰ª 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1, Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall, the form of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the Î”Î”Gfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value â‰ª 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However, it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger, as we show later, this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (Î”Î”Gfold) and binding (Î”Î”Gbind) free energy changes for Single, Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V, G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements, whereas other mutations (S376F, Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example, L405P located in the middle of an Î±-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations, especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters, compared to random mutations (p-value â‰ª 0.01, Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations, therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value â‰ª 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state, consistent with experiments, we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability, recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B, S1 and Table S2). Importantly, cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next, all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations, Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them, several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example, the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal molâˆ’1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10, 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family, it strongly interacts with the Q92, W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q, R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation, there are 49 heterozygous (â€œHeteroâ€�) and 27 homozygous (â€œHomoâ€�) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall, we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 â€“ 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 â€“ 0.003) (Fig. 2B, Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6, 38, 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL, then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele, it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed, human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status, trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples, and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods, Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A, in the presence of wild-type CBL, activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type, CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells, predicted changes in stability (Î”Î”Gfold kcal molâˆ’1), binding affinity (Î”Î”Gbind kcal molâˆ’1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging, attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R, H398Q, Y371H, K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R, H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand, the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This, in turn, could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover, K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B,C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally, the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V, V430M, P428L, Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this, the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific, we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells, transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this, the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells, the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example, the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models, whereas V430M, consistent with experimental data, had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally, the third group constituted mutations (L399V, G375P, P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this, there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly, mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast, the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and Î”Î”Gfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed, the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of Î”Î”Gfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5, changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison, several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy, they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52, with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 (A) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (exponential model) and maximal predicted changes in stability. (B) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (linear model) and predicted changes in binding affinity of pCBL-E2-S state. ... There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations, (30â€“33, 41) and some of them use structural features (31, 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However, all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5, all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEANâ€™s score (R=0.58, Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural, foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand, thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites, which might not be energetically optimal (36, 42). In tumorigenesis, protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level, but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43, 44). However, the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein, here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies, which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation, we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity), while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study, about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity, while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models, we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However, these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed, many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations, but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly, the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene, their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47), where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48, 49). Importantly, all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact, the correlation between Î”Î”Gfold and Î”Î”Gbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 â€“ 0.48 depending on the CBL state, p-value &lt; 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants, one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However, as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes, this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall, our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity, of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases, of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However, there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1), CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand, as shown in our study and in other studies, cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL, so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies, understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed, targeted therapies. Our approach, which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest, emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Oncogenic mutations in the monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors, but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study, we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability, binding, and activity. We found that recurrent, homozygous, and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2, by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and, to a lesser extent, with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding, whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity, and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL, driver mutations, protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations), the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability, interactions, and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures, their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2, 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity, stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5, 6). Strikingly, proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain (TKBD), a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain, while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time, since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain, they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9, 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK, CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein, thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study, substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach, which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability, binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely, we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent, homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.  Go to: Materials and Methods Computational modeling and analysis  Mapping of CBL mutations The COSMIC database (15) stores data on somatic cancer mutations and integrates the experimental data from full-genome sequencing studies. We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations), zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations), types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition, all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a â€œRandomâ€� missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures, we obtained 2,102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL), (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S), (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13), CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%, the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Ã…. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Ã… from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40,000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  Î”Gbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î”Gbindmut-Î”GbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î±Î”Î”Evdw+Î²Î”Î”Gsolv+Î³Î”SAmut+ÎµÎ”Î”GBM+Î»Î”Î”GFD+Î´ (3) Here Î”Î”Evdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and Î”Î”Gsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. Î”SAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. Î”Î”GBM and Î”Î”GFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX, respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation, optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( Î”Gfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( Î”GfoldWT).  Î”Î”Gfold=Î”Gfoldmut-Î”GfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27), the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). (See Supplementary Methods for more information.)  Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs, described above, were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T, the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega, Madison, WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15, A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15, and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp., Madison, WI), incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change, and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins, cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbeccoâ€™s PBS-containing 200 Î¼M sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals, Fairlawn, NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO], 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors [Complete tabsÂ®, Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16,000 Ã— g for 15 m at 4 Â°C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA). For immunoblotting, 20Î¼g of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue, 0.3573 M Î²-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations, 150 Î¼g of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer, then resuspended in 2X loading buffer, boiled for 5 m, then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman, Sanford, MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins, the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling), rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase, (clone 3F10; Roche), rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc., South Plainfield, NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc., Long Beach, CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination, in the presence of each CBL mutation, was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes, Î”Î”Gfold, upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35, 36). Namely, the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal molâˆ’1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations, recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value â‰ª 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1, Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall, the form of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the Î”Î”Gfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value â‰ª 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However, it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger, as we show later, this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (Î”Î”Gfold) and binding (Î”Î”Gbind) free energy changes for Single, Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V, G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements, whereas other mutations (S376F, Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example, L405P located in the middle of an Î±-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations, especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters, compared to random mutations (p-value â‰ª 0.01, Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations, therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value â‰ª 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state, consistent with experiments, we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability, recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B, S1 and Table S2). Importantly, cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next, all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations, Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them, several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example, the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal molâˆ’1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10, 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family, it strongly interacts with the Q92, W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q, R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation, there are 49 heterozygous (â€œHeteroâ€�) and 27 homozygous (â€œHomoâ€�) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall, we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 â€“ 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 â€“ 0.003) (Fig. 2B, Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6, 38, 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL, then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele, it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed, human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status, trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples, and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods, Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A, in the presence of wild-type CBL, activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type, CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells, predicted changes in stability (Î”Î”Gfold kcal molâˆ’1), binding affinity (Î”Î”Gbind kcal molâˆ’1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging, attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R, H398Q, Y371H, K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R, H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand, the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This, in turn, could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover, K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B,C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally, the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V, V430M, P428L, Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this, the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific, we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells, transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this, the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells, the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example, the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models, whereas V430M, consistent with experimental data, had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally, the third group constituted mutations (L399V, G375P, P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this, there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly, mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast, the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and Î”Î”Gfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed, the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of Î”Î”Gfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5, changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison, several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy, they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52, with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 (A) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (exponential model) and maximal predicted changes in stability. (B) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (linear model) and predicted changes in binding affinity of pCBL-E2-S state. ... There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations, (30â€“33, 41) and some of them use structural features (31, 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However, all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5, all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEANâ€™s score (R=0.58, Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural, foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand, thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites, which might not be energetically optimal (36, 42). In tumorigenesis, protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level, but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43, 44). However, the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein, here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies, which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation, we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity), while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study, about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity, while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models, we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However, these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed, many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations, but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly, the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene, their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47), where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48, 49). Importantly, all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact, the correlation between Î”Î”Gfold and Î”Î”Gbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 â€“ 0.48 depending on the CBL state, p-value &lt; 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants, one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However, as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes, this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall, our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity, of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases, of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However, there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1), CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand, as shown in our study and in other studies, cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL, so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies, understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed, targeted therapies. Our approach, which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest, emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Oncogenic mutations in the monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors, but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study, we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability, binding, and activity. We found that recurrent, homozygous, and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2, by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and, to a lesser extent, with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding, whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity, and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL, driver mutations, protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations), the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability, interactions, and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures, their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2, 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity, stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5, 6). Strikingly, proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain (TKBD), a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain, while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time, since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain, they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9, 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK, CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein, thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study, substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach, which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability, binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely, we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent, homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.  Go to: Materials and Methods Computational modeling and analysis  Mapping of CBL mutations The COSMIC database (15) stores data on somatic cancer mutations and integrates the experimental data from full-genome sequencing studies. We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations), zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations), types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition, all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a â€œRandomâ€� missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures, we obtained 2,102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL), (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S), (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13), CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%, the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Ã…. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Ã… from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40,000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  Î”Gbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î”Gbindmut-Î”GbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î±Î”Î”Evdw+Î²Î”Î”Gsolv+Î³Î”SAmut+ÎµÎ”Î”GBM+Î»Î”Î”GFD+Î´ (3) Here Î”Î”Evdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and Î”Î”Gsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. Î”SAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. Î”Î”GBM and Î”Î”GFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX, respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation, optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( Î”Gfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( Î”GfoldWT).  Î”Î”Gfold=Î”Gfoldmut-Î”GfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27), the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). (See Supplementary Methods for more information.)  Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs, described above, were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T, the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega, Madison, WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15, A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15, and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp., Madison, WI), incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change, and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins, cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbeccoâ€™s PBS-containing 200 Î¼M sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals, Fairlawn, NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO], 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors [Complete tabsÂ®, Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16,000 Ã— g for 15 m at 4 Â°C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA). For immunoblotting, 20Î¼g of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue, 0.3573 M Î²-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations, 150 Î¼g of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer, then resuspended in 2X loading buffer, boiled for 5 m, then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman, Sanford, MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins, the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling), rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase, (clone 3F10; Roche), rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc., South Plainfield, NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc., Long Beach, CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination, in the presence of each CBL mutation, was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes, Î”Î”Gfold, upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35, 36). Namely, the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal molâˆ’1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations, recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value â‰ª 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1, Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall, the form of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the Î”Î”Gfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value â‰ª 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However, it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger, as we show later, this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (Î”Î”Gfold) and binding (Î”Î”Gbind) free energy changes for Single, Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V, G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements, whereas other mutations (S376F, Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example, L405P located in the middle of an Î±-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations, especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters, compared to random mutations (p-value â‰ª 0.01, Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations, therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value â‰ª 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state, consistent with experiments, we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability, recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B, S1 and Table S2). Importantly, cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next, all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations, Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them, several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example, the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal molâˆ’1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10, 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family, it strongly interacts with the Q92, W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q, R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation, there are 49 heterozygous (â€œHeteroâ€�) and 27 homozygous (â€œHomoâ€�) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall, we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 â€“ 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 â€“ 0.003) (Fig. 2B, Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6, 38, 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL, then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele, it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed, human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status, trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples, and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods, Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A, in the presence of wild-type CBL, activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type, CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells, predicted changes in stability (Î”Î”Gfold kcal molâˆ’1), binding affinity (Î”Î”Gbind kcal molâˆ’1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging, attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R, H398Q, Y371H, K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R, H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand, the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This, in turn, could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover, K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B,C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally, the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V, V430M, P428L, Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this, the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific, we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells, transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this, the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells, the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example, the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models, whereas V430M, consistent with experimental data, had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally, the third group constituted mutations (L399V, G375P, P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this, there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly, mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast, the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and Î”Î”Gfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed, the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of Î”Î”Gfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5, changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison, several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy, they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52, with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 (A) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (exponential model) and maximal predicted changes in stability. (B) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (linear model) and predicted changes in binding affinity of pCBL-E2-S state. ... There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations, (30â€“33, 41) and some of them use structural features (31, 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However, all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5, all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEANâ€™s score (R=0.58, Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural, foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand, thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites, which might not be energetically optimal (36, 42). In tumorigenesis, protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level, but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43, 44). However, the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein, here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies, which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation, we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity), while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study, about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity, while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models, we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However, these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed, many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations, but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly, the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene, their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47), where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48, 49). Importantly, all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact, the correlation between Î”Î”Gfold and Î”Î”Gbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 â€“ 0.48 depending on the CBL state, p-value &lt; 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants, one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However, as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes, this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall, our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity, of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases, of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However, there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1), CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand, as shown in our study and in other studies, cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL, so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies, understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed, targeted therapies. Our approach, which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest, emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.</td>\n",

       "      <td>CBL is a negative regulator of activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). In this study, we determined the frequency of CBL mutations in acute leukemias and evaluated the oncogenic potential of mutant CBL. Experimental Design: The cDNA of 300 acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients and 82 human leukemic cell lines was screened for aberrations in the linker and RING finger domain of CBL. The oncogenic potential of identified mutants was evaluated in hematopoietic cells. Results:We identified 3 of 279 AML/MDS patients expressingCBL exon 8/9 deletion mutants. Three of four cases at diagnosis expressed deleted transcripts missing exon 8 or exon 8/9. In remission samples a weak or no expression of mutant CBL was detected. No aberrations were found in normal hematopoietic tissues. One of 116 sequenced AML/MDS cases carried a R420G missense mutation. All AML/MDS patients with identified CBL mutants belonged to the core bindingfactor and 11q deletion AML subtypes. Functionally, CBL negatively regulated FMSlike tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) activity and interacted with human FLT3 via the autophosphorylation sitesY589 andY599 and colocalized in vivo. Expression of CBLDexon8 and CBLDexon8+9 in FLT3-WT-Ba/F3 cells induced growth factor ^ independent proliferation associated with autophosphorylation of FLT3 and activated the downstream targets signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) and protein kinase B (AKT). FLT3 ligand ^ dependent hyperproliferation of CBL mutant cells could be abrogated by treatment with the FLT3 PTK inhibitor PKC412 (midostaurin). Conclusion: CBL exon8/9 mutants occur in genetically defined AML/MDS subtypes and transform hematopoietic cells by constitutively activatingthe FLT3 pathway. This phenotype resembles the one of mutated RTKs and suggests that CBL mutant AML patients might benefit from treatment with FLT3 PTK inhibitors. CBL, a known negative regulator of activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), is localized on human chromosome 11q23, a region frequently associated with chromosomal aberrations. Translocations t(4;11) and t(11;14), and mixed-lineage leukemia fusion genes involving CBL have been described in patients with leukemia and lymphoma (1â€“3). CBL oncogenes were initially identified in the murine system. CBL-70Z, carrying an internal deletion of 17 amino acids, was isolated from the 70Z/ 3 mouse pre-B-cell lymphoma cell line (4). CBL-70Z deregulates the cellular tyrosine kinase machinery, as NIH3T3 serumstarved cells expressing CBL-70Z showed significantly increased endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase activity after EGF stimulation (5). p95CBL, expressed in the murine reticulum sarcoma cell line J-774, lacks internal 111 amino acids, comprising whole exons 8 and 9 (6). CBL70Z and p95CBL mutations both target the linker and RING finger domain, which points to a mutation-sensitive region within the CBL protein. Recently the first human CBL mutation has been reported in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; ref. 7).

Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer in the RING finger domain (8, 9) and was shown to inhibit FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitylation (7). Additional screenings of AML patients revealed more cases with CBL mutations, including internal deletions of exon 8 and point mutations targeting G375 (10, 11). Activating FLT3 mutations represent one of the most common genetic alterations in AML and are associated with a poor prognosis (12). Overexpression of wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-WT) has been shown to synergize with other oncogenic fusions to induce aggressive AML in mice (13). Because of these reasons, FLT3 is a prominent target for therapeutic intervention. Currently two compounds targeting FLT3 kinase activity, PKC412 (midostaurin) and CEP701(lestaurtinib), have reached clinical phase III (14). As patients that do not carry activating FLT3 mutations benefit from treatment with FLT3 inhibitors (15), we hypothesized that other mechanisms, such as CBL mutations, might contribute to the oncogenic potential of FLT3. Here, we report a frequency of 1.1% of CBL exon8/9 mutations in AML/ myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Three of the four newly diagnosed AML/MDS patients expressed CBL lacking exon 8 or exon 8/9 and one patient carried a R420G missense mutation. Aberrant CBL transcripts were lost in remission samples. CBL is part of the human FLT3 downstream signaling pathway and promoted down-regulation of FLT3 activity. Finally, CBL deletion mutants CBLDExon8 and CBL exon8/9 transformed Ba/F3 cells in the presence, but not in the absence of FLT3-WT. Materials and Methods Analysis of cell lines and patient samples. The study design adhered to the principles of the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the ethics committees of participating institutions. Cell culture, cDNA, and genomic DNA synthesis were done as described previously (16). PCR screening of cDNA was done with forward primer 5Â¶-CATCCTGGCTACATGGCTTT-3Â¶, localized in exon 5, and reverse primer 5Â¶-GCAGAAGCACTTGAGGGAAC-3Â¶, localized in exon 10, yielding a 752-bp PCR product corresponding to nucleotides 793 to 1544 of the published human CBL sequence (genebank accession number NM_005188). Sequencing was done using the forward primer. For screening of normal human hematopoietic tissues the Human MTC panel II (Clontech) was used. For analysis of gDNA a 8050-bp fragment was amplified using forward primer 5Â¶-GACTAATGTGGCCTACAAATCCTAA-3Â¶, localized in intron 6, and reverse primer 5Â¶-GTTGGTTAATTCTCTTCCTGTCCA-3Â¶, localized in exon 11. Sequencing was done using the forward and reverse primer as well as the following primers: 5Â¶-CTGTTAACATTTATAATTGCAGT-3Â¶, 5Â¶-GACAGATATTGTGTTAAGCAC-3Â¶, 5Â¶-GAGTGAGTTGTGATTGTACC-3Â¶. 5Â¶-TAGCTGGATGGTAGGTAAGT-3Â¶, 5Â¶-ATAGTAGTATGTGATACCGTG-3Â¶, 5Â¶-TTCCTCATCCTTGATTTGATG-3Â¶, 5Â¶-GCTTGTTAGGGAGTTGTGG-3Â¶, 5Â¶-CAAAGAGTTAAAGATGAGAGC-3Â¶, 5Â¶-GATCTCACTATGTTGACAAGGC-3Â¶. PCR fragment analysis was done as described previously (17) with forward primer 5Â¶-TGGCTTATGTGAACCAACTCC-3Â¶ in exon 7 and reverse primer 5Â¶-CTTGAGGGAACACATACTCG-3Â¶ in exon 10 yielding peaks at 483 (CBL-WT), 353 (CBLDexon8) and 148 (CBLDexon8/9) nucleotides.

Translational Relevance In this article we provide detailed insight into the role of oncogenic CBL exon8/9 mutations in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but we could not find CBL mutations in our acute lymphoblastic leukemia cohort. Analysis of a large cohort of AML/MDS patients of different cytogenetic subgroups revealed an overall low frequency of CBL exon 8+9 deletions of 1.1%. However, we identified preferential association of CBL exon8/9 mutations with core bindingfactor leukemias and 11q aberrations. We describe that all known human CBL deletion mutants lead to transformation of wild-type FLT3 ^ expressing hematopoietic cells. This phenotype resembles that seen with activated receptor tyrosine kinases. Therefore, it is of particular note that analysis of CBL should be introduced in routine leukemia diagnostics, as patients who harbor CBL mutations might benefit from treatment with FLT3 protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Results A subset of AML/MDS patients carries mutations in the protooncogene CBL. Recent reports have indicated a putative contribution of CBL mutations to the pathogenesis of human leukemias (7, 10). To obtain a comprehensive insight into the role of CBL in human acute leukemias, we firstly did a PCR screening of the cDNA of 61AML and 21acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines (Table 1; Supplementary Table S1) for deletions in the linker and RING finger domains. We identified a monoallelic CBL deletion transcript in the AML cell line MOLM-13 and the sister cell line MOLM-14. Sequencing of the aberrant transcripts revealed loss of the complete coding sequence of exon 8. All other analyzed cell lines expressed exclusively wild-type CBL (CBL-WT). Secondly, we used the above PCR screening assay to analyze a well-characterized cohort of AML/MDS and ALL patient samples for the presence of aberrant CBL transcripts (Table 1A). Among 279 AML samples of different cytogenetic subtypes and 21T-cell ALL samples we detected three AML/MDS patients expressing CBLWT as well as an aberrant CBL transcript (Table 1B). Patient 1 with a t(8;21) (AML1/ETO positive) and patient 2 with an 11q deletion both expressed a CBL transcript lacking exon 8, and patient 3 with an inv(16) (CBFB/MYH11 positive) expressed CBL lacking exon 8 and 9 (Table 1B; Fig. 1A). By PCR fragment analysis we determined the relative expression of mutant versus CBL-WT. For patient 1we detected 40% mutant versus 60% wild-type transcript. For patient 2 a 20% mutant versus 80% wild-type transcript was observed, supposedly due to the low blast count (20%) in the patient sample. Patient 3 showed equal ratios of mutant versus wild-type transcripts (data not shown). To verify that the shorter CBL transcripts were expressed in the malignant cell population, we analyzed remission samples in the case of patients 1and 3. Conventional PCR screening of remission samples from patient 1showed a weak expression of the transcript lacking exon 8 (Fig. 1B). PCR fragment analysis revealed that still 15% to 20% of the mutant CBL was present in the remission sample (data not shown). In case of patient 3 the PCR screening as well as the fragment analysis showed loss of the mutant CBL transcript lacking exon 8 and 9 in remission. To exclude the possibility of normally occurring splice variants, we analyzed the cDNA of normal human hematopoietic tissues, in detail normal bone marrow, peripheral leukocytes, spleen, and thymus. All of the analyzed tissues expressed exclusively CBL-WT transcripts (data not shown). In addition to the PCR screening, a subset of 116 PCR products from AML/MDS patients of all subtypes were analyzed by nucleotide sequencing comprising the region of exon 7, 8 and 9. One AML/MDS patient with an 11q aberration showed a substitution of arginine to glycine at position 420, which is located in the RING finger domain (Table 1B, Fig. 1A). In summary, we identified 2 of 61AML cell lines [3.3% (0.4%, 11.3%)] and 3 of 279 (1.1%) AML/MDS patients expressing aberrant CBL transcripts deleted in the linker and RING finger domains of CBL. Aberrant CBL transcripts could not be detected in any of the analyzed ALL cell lines and ALL patient samples. A murine CBL deletion transcript has been described in the 70Z/3 B-cell lymphoma cell line (CBL-70Z lacking the first 17 amino acids of exon 8; ref. 4). In the 70Z/3 line the causative event is a splice site mutation, changing the splice acceptor site AG to CG, generating an alternative splice site, which excludes the first 17 amino acids of exon 8 (Fig. 1A). Analysis of the genomic DNA of MOLM-13 cells detected a deletion of 14 nucleotides at the exon 8/intron 8 boundary eliminating a Table 1. A.

Two patients belong to CBF leukemias [t(8;21); inv(16)] and two patients harbor 11q aberrations. *A detailed listing of all cell lines is given in Supplementary Table 1.

Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer splicing element leading to expression of the CBLDexon8 mutant (data not shown), as had been described previously (10). By amplifying a 8,050-bp fragment of genomic DNA spanning intron 6 to exon 11 and subsequent nucleotide sequencing, we detected mutations in all three patients expressing aberrant CBL transcripts (data not shown). One allele of patient 1(CBLDexon8) harbored a deletion of 43 nucleotides at the exon 8-intron 8 boundary, including the last 36 nucleotides of exon 8 and the first 7 nucleotides of intron 8, thereby losing the whole splice donor site of intron 8. Analysis of the genomic DNA of patient 2 (CBLDexon8) revealed a point mutation of the splice donor site of intron 8, changing the conserved â€˜â€˜GTâ€™â€™ to â€˜â€˜GCâ€™â€™ in about 10% of the amplified DNA. The sample from patient 2 contained only 20% blasts, suggesting that this mutation occurred in one of the CBL alleles of the malignant clone. Patient 3 (CBLDexon8+9) carries a monoallelic large genomic deletion of 1,680 nucleotides, starting in intron 7 and ending in intron 9 leading to the loss of exon 8 and 9. In conclusion, all CBL transcripts, which lack whole exons, can be explained by genomic events that target splice donor or acceptor sites by mutations or deletions. CBL interacts with the FLT3 receptor and contributes to FLT3 downstream signaling. As CBL is known to be involved in the signal transduction of class III RTKs, platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA), FMS (colony forming growth factor 1 receptor), and KIT (stem cell factor receptor) (19â€“ 21), we hypothesized that CBL mutants might play a role in human FLT3 downstream signaling. Lysates of FLT3-WT expressing Ba/ F3 cells with or without FLT3 ligand stimulation were analyzed for the phosphorylation status of endogenous CBL. We could show that activation of human FLT3 after binding of FLT3 ligand leads to high levels of phosphorylated CBL in FLT3-WTâ€“ expressing cells, whereas the kinase-dead mutant receptor (FLT3-R644K) cells do not show phosphorylated CBL (Fig. 2A). To localize the interaction site within the FLT3-WT receptor we substituted two essential in vivo autophosphorylation sites of FLT3, tyrosines Y589 and Y599 (22), with phenylalanine. FLT3Y589F and FLT3Y599F receptorâ€“expressing cells show a remarkable decrease of CBL phosphorylation after FLT3 ligand stimulation compared with FLT3-WT â€“ expressing cells (Fig. 2A). We conclude that Y589 and Y599 participate in the interaction of the FLT3 receptor with CBL. To detect interaction of FLT3 and CBL, we did coimmunoprecipitation experiments with lysates from FLT3 ligand â€“ stimulated cells expressing V5-tagged FLT3-WT alone or together with CBLWT or CBL-70Z. Figure 2B shows that CBL-WT and CBL-70Z, interact with the FLT3 receptor. The FLT3 receptor is generally detected as two distinct bands, the mature glycosylated form at 155 kDa and the immature cytoplasmic form at 130 kDa (23). The interaction between CBL-WT and CBL-70Z with FLT3 occurred predominantly with the mature form of FLT3 (higher band). To study the interaction between the FLT3 receptor and CBL at the cellular level, we did in vivo colocalization experiments using immunofluorescence of FLT3 and CBL-WT. In U2OS human osteosarcoma cells transiently transfected FLT3 localizes to the cell membrane and the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C). In the cytoplasm FLT3 accumulates in the perinuclear endoplasmatic reticulum, consistent with recent reports (24). CBL shows a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution. Stimulation of the cells with FLT3 ligand results in internalization of FLT3, which is indicated by loss of FLT3 staining in the cell membrane and formation of endosomal vesicles. Upon addition of FLT3 ligand, CBL clearly colocalizes with internalized FLT3 in the endosomal vesicles. CBL regulates the function of EGFR via ubiquitin-dependent degradation of EGFR (25, 26). Therefore, we sought to investigate if CBL negatively regulates human FLT3. Two hundred and ninety-three cells were transiently transfected with FLT3-WT alone or FLT3-WT and CBL-WT and stimulated with FLT3 ligand for different time periods. Lysates were analyzed for FLT3 phosphorylation and total levels of FLT3 protein. Figure 2D shows constant phosphorylation and levels of FLT3 protein in FLT3-WTâ€“ transfected cells up to 120 minutes, Fig. 1. Identified CBL mutants in AML patients. Aberrant CBL transcripts are lost in remission.

Shown below are the CBL deletion mutants, CBLDexon8 and CBLDexon8+9, found in AML patients, CBL-70Z, a known oncogenic form of CBL, comprisinga deletion of the first 17 amino acids within exon 8, and the location of R420, found to be mutated in one AML patient in our study.

Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer whereas the phospho-tyrosine signal is comparably less in double-transfected cells after 60 minutes and barely detectable after 120 minutes. The total protein levels of FLT3 are significantly reduced after 90 minutes of FLT3 ligand stimulation in the double-transfected cells compared with FLT3-WT â€“ transfected cells, implicating an enhanced degradation of FLT3 by CBL. CBL mutants confer a transforming potential to Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-WT. In light of the direct interaction between FLT3 and CBL and the modulation of FLT3 signaling by CBL, we hypothesized that CBL mutants could activate the oncogenic potential of FLT3-WT in AML blasts. The following CBL mutants found in AML/MDS patients and leukemic cell lines, CBLDexon8, CBLDexon8+9 and CBLR420 and CBLG375 point mutants, as well as CBL-WT and CBL-70Z as a positive control, were generated and subcloned into MSCVGFP. FLT3-WT was subcloned into MSCV-YFP vector. All CBL constructs were stably expressed alone or together with FLT3- WT in Ba/F3 cells. Positive selection was done by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting. The expression of transduced human CBL in FLT3-WT/CBL coexpressing cells was higher than the expression of endogenous CBL, as analyzed by real time quantitative-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S1A) and verified by Western Blot analysis for the CBLDexon8+9 mutant (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Expression of any single CBL construct alone or coexpression of CBL-WT and FLT3-WT did not confer growth factor independent proliferation to Ba/F3 cells (data not shown). However, coexpression of CBL-70Z, CBLDexon8 or CBLDexon8+9 with FLT3-WT led to significant IL-3 independent proliferation (Fig. 3A). Compared with the CBL deletion mutants, expression of CBL R420G, R420Q, G375S, and G375P point mutants did not confer any proliferative capacity, but enhanced cell survival, as 50% of cells survived for 3 days after IL-3 withdrawal compared with 10% survival of the control cells (data not shown). The presence of FLT3 ligand induced a strong dosedependent proliferation of FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z, FLT3-WT/ CBLDexon8, and FLT3-WT/CBLDexon8+9 cotransduced cells Fig. 2. CBL is phosphorylated after activation of human FLT3-WT, directly interacts with FLT3 through tyrosines Y589 and Y599, and negatively regulates FLT3WT.

B, 293 cells were transfected with MIY (control),V5-tagged FLT3-WT CBL-WTorV5-tagged FLT3-WT CBL-70Z and stimulated with 100 ng/mL FLT3 ligand for 5 min. Coimmunoprecipitation of CBL and FLT3 was done with polyclonal CBL antibody. After separation on SDS-PAGE and blottingon nitrocellulose membrane, V5-tagged FLT3-WTwas detected with monoclonal V5 antibody. Control samples contained either no or unspecific IgG antibody.

Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer with a proliferation rate about 4 to 6 times higher than the control cells (Fig. 3B). The FLT3-WT/CBLG375 cotransduced cells showed no increase in proliferation rate compared with FLT3-WT cells. The FLT3-WT/CBLR420Q mutant cells showed a 2-fold enhanced proliferation rate compared with FLT3-WT cells (data not shown). Incubation of the FLT3-WT/CBL mutant coexpressing cells with the FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 in increasing nontoxic concentrations up to 50 nmol/L or the FLT3 inhibitor SU5614 up to 5 Amol/L in the presence of 50 ng/mL FLT3 ligand led to a dose-dependent abrogation of the proliferation (Fig. 3C). Coexpression of a kinase-dead FLT3 receptor, FLT3K644R, with CBL-70Z provided further evidence that the FLT3 kinase activity is required for the transformed phenotype, as it did not lead to IL-3 â€“independent proliferation (data not shown). Collectively, the overexpression of CBL-70Z, CBLDexon8 or CBLDexon8+9 in FLT3-WT â€“expressing Ba/F3 cells led to factor independent growth and FLT3 ligandâ€“ dependent hyperproliferation. Coexpression of CBL deletion mutants with FLT3-WT autoactivates the FLT3 receptor. The known classes of FLT3 mutations have been shown to autoactivate the kinase activity of FLT3 (16, 27â€“ 30). We prepared lysates of FLT3 ligand â€“ stimulated and nonstimulated Ba/F3 cells coexpressing FLT3- WT and a CBL deletion mutant, immunoprecipitated the FLT3 receptor, and analyzed it for tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast to FLT3-WT- or FLT3-WT/CBL-WT â€“expressing cells, all three CBL mutantâ€“expressing cells displayed autophosphorylated FLT3 in the absence of FLT3 ligand (Fig. 4A). Stimulation with FLT3 ligand induced high phosphorylation levels of FLT3 Fig. 3.

B, cells were analyzed accordingto A, but different concentrations of FL up to 100 ng/mL were added to the culture medium. C, cells were analyzed accordingto A, but 50 ng/mL FLT3 ligand and different concentrations of the FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 up to 50 nmol/L or SU5614 up to 5 Amol/L were added to the culture medium. Three independent experiments were done. CBL exon8/9 Mutants in AML/MDS Subtypes www.aacrjournals.org 2243 Clin Cancer Res 2009;15(7) April 1, 2009 Research. Downloaded from clincancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 27, 2017. Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer in all analyzed cells. The amount of phosphorylated FLT3 in FLT3-WT/CBL mutantâ€“expressing cells was considerably higher than in control cells, as was the amount of total FLT3 protein. This confirms the hypothesis that coexpression of a CBL deletion mutant, but not CBL-WT, leads to a remarkable stabilization of the FLT3 protein within the cells by inhibiting the down-regulation and degradation of the FLT3 protein. Analysis of the phosphorylation status of transduced CBL in FLT3-WT/CBL mutant â€“expressing cells revealed that all CBL mutants became phosphorylated after stimulation of the cells with FLT3 ligand (Fig. 4B). Of note, we detected a weak constitutive phosphorylation of CBL mutants, but not CBL-WT, in the absence of FL. Autoactivation of FLT3 results in ligand-independent signaling of the receptor (31, 32). We therefore analyzed the activation of three important downstream signaling effectors of FLT3: signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinases B (AKT), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Activated STAT5 and AKT were detected in unstimulated FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z-, Fig. 4. Coexpression of CBL deletion mutants autoactivates FLT3, CBL mutants, and the downstream signaling pathways STAT5 and AKTA, Mock, FLT3-WT, FLT3-WT/CBL-WT, FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z, FLT3-WT/CBLDexon8, and FLT3-WT/ CBLDexon8+9 cells were starved for 24 h in the presence of 0.3% FCS and unstimulated or stimulated with 100 ng/mL FLT3 ligand for 5 min. FLT3 was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal FLT3 antibody and analyzed by immunoblottingwith phospho-tyrosine antibody, stripped, and reprobed with FLT3 antibody. B, CBL-WTand CBL mutant proteins were immunoprecipitated with hemagglutinin- orV5-antibody and analyzed as described in A. C, cells were treated accordingtoA and crude cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed for phosphorylation of STAT5 and AKTusing phospho-specific antibodies. D, WST proliferation assays were done in presence of FLT3 ligand and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin.

Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer FLT3-WT/CBLDexon8-, and FLT3-WT/CBLDexon8+9 â€“ coexpressing cells but not FLT3-WT- or FLT3-WT/CBL-WT â€“ coexpressing cells (Fig. 4C). However, no differences were observed in MAPK activation, as all unstimulated cells lack phosphorylated MAPK (data not shown). To evaluate the contribution of the PI3K pathway to the FLT3 ligand â€“ dependent proliferation of FLT3-WT/CBL mutant â€“ expressing cells, we analyzed the proliferative capacity of FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z â€“ coexpressing cells and FLT3-WT/CBL-WT control cells in the presence of the small molecule inhibitors LY294002 and rapamycin. LY294002 is a well known PI3K inhibitor (33) and rapamycin specifically inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, a downstream target of PI3K (34, 35). Both compounds were able to significantly, but not totally, inhibit the proliferation of FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z cells (Fig. 4D). The IC50 value for FLT3- WT/CBL-70Z â€“expressing cells were 3.8 Amol/L for LY294002 and 0.5 nmol/L for rapamycin, pointing to a strong contribution of the PI3K/AKT pathway to the transforming phenotype of FLT3/CBL mutant â€“ coexpressing cells. Incubation of the cells with the maximum used concentration of inhibitor in presence of IL-3 was not cytotoxic (data not shown). Expression of CBL-70Z in FLT3-WT cells does not alter the internalization of the FLT3 receptor. Analysis of EGFR activity has shown that CBL promotes the invagination of the plasma membrane during receptor endocytosis (25, 26, 36). CBL-70Z has been proposed to act in a dominant negative manner preventing binding of CBL-WT to activated RTKs (37). We intended to analyze whether the expression of CBL-WT or CBL-70Z might alter the rate or timing of FLT3 internalization after activation with FLT3 ligand. We did staining of FLT3 or FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z â€“expressing cells with CD135 antibody to detect the levels of FLT3 on the surface dependent on the time of FLT3 ligand stimulation up to 60 minutes. In FLT3-WT cells the FLT3 receptor is rapidly internalized after 10 to 20 minutes of FLT3 ligand stimulation (Fig. 5). In contrast to FLT3-WT the kinase-dead FLT3K644R, which served as a control, was not internalized even after 60 minutes of FLT3 ligand stimulation. Coexpression of CBL-WT (data not shown) or the mutant CBL- 70Z had no effect on the receptor turnover as after 20 minutes of FLT3 ligand stimulation FLT3 was undetectable on the cell surface in all analyzed cells. Discussion Growth factors and their associated membrane bound receptors play an important role in the initiation and propagation of many types of cancer (38). As the aberrant activation of RTKs by overexpression and activating mutations is a well-investigated topic in oncology research, it is becoming increasingly clear that impaired receptor down-regulation might contribute to the malignant phenotype as well (39). Receptor down-regulation involves ligand-induced endocytosis and subsequent degradation of the proteins in the lysosomes, leading to termination of RTK signaling and, in case of disturbance, to aberrantly extended signaling. Recent findings have addressed the aberrant down-regulation of FLT3 by CBL in AML (7, 10, 11). In this study we provide a comprehensive insight by analyzing 300 AML/MDS and ALL cases. Four of 279 AML/MDS patients, but no ALL patients, were found positive for expression of aberrant CBL transcripts in the linker and RING finger domains, previously characterized as the critical location for transforming mutations. The equivalently analyzed large number of AML and ALL cell lines revealed two positive AML cell lines, MOLM-13 and the sister cell line MOLM-14, which matches the results obtained in patient material and points to a low frequency of CBL mutations in AML. However, an independent study found 1of 12 AML patients with a point mutation in CBL-b (10), a CBL family member, highlighting the importance of further studies to determine the contribution of CBL members to the pathogenesis of AML (10). Of more importance was whether other aberrations in other negative regulatory molecules, e.g. SHP phosphatases, lead to deregulated RTK activity. Three of the described aberrant CBL transcripts lack whole exons, which were significantly decreased in expression or not detectable in the patientâ€™s remission controls. Screening of Fig. 5. The internalization of FLT3-WT is not disturbed by coexpression of CBL70Z. Ba/F3 cells expressingFLT3-WT, FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z, or FLT3-KD were stimulated with FLT3 ligand for different time periods from 0 min up to 60 min. After stimulation cells were immediately incubated on ice and cell membranes fixed by addition of 0.3% sodium azide. Cells were stained with FLT3-specific surface antibody and analyzed in fluorescence-activated cell sorter for surface expression levels of FLT3.

Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer normal hematopoietic tissues did not show aberrant CBL transcripts, further pointing to an oncogenic event in the malignant clone. Indeed, all three patients carried genomic lesions affecting splice donor or acceptor sites by mutation or deletion, so that we can clearly exclude aberrant splicing events within the malignant clone. Of note, we detected a preferential association of CBL mutations with specific subtypes of AML/MDS. Among 43 cases of core binding factor leukemias [t(8;21) and inv(16)] two patients expressing aberrant CBL transcripts were identified [4.7% (0.6%, 15.8%)]. As core binding factor leukemias show a high expression of the RTK KIT (40), further studies need to address the question of whether CBL mutations might lead to autoactivation of KIT in these patients. Two of 13 patients with 11q deletions were found positive [15.4% (1.9%, 45.4%)]. This AML/MDS subgroup shows the highest FLT3 expression among all AML subgroups (41), so that CBL mutations might be the event causing the high FLT3 expression and an aberrant FLT3 activation in these patients. CBL was shown to be responsible for ubiquitination of several receptors including EGFR, PDGFRA, and FMS (25, 42, 43). Until now only indirect evidence existed for a role of CBL in human FLT3 downstream signaling. Lavagna-Sevenier et al. reported prominent CBL phosphorylation in human hematopoietic cell lines expressing endogenous FLT3 (44). Recently Sargin et al. reported the physical interaction of CBL with a murine chimeric FLT3 receptor, where the juxtamembrane domain has been replaced by human sequences (7). Their study presents further indirect evidence that CBL is the responsible E3 ligase ubiquitinating the chimeric murine FLT3 receptor after binding of FLT3 ligand. However, this remains to be tested for human FLT3. Here, we provide clear evidence that murine endogenous CBL is rapidly phosphorylated after activation of the human FLT3-WT receptor. As murine and human CBL share 92% homology, we conclude that this signaling event is conserved from mice to humans. Recently Heiss et al. identified two important in vivo autophosphorylation sites of human FLT3 after FLT3 ligand stimulation, tyrosines 589 and 599, which associate with important signaling molecules, like Src family members and SHP2 (22). Mutation of Y589 and Y599 to phenylalanine revealed a significantly decreased phosphorylation of CBL in response to FLT3 ligand stimulation of the mutant FLT3 receptors, implicating that these tyrosines serve as docking sites. A similar effect has been seen for the corresponding juxtamembrane tyrosines Y568 and Y570 in KIT and Y572 and Y574 in PDGFRa (21 , 45). However, as still small amounts of phosphorylated CBL were detectable, we propose that FLT3 contains more interaction sites for CBL, which might be direct or indirect via adaptor proteins, e.g. GRB2. Additional COOHterminal association sites of CBL have been described for FMS (Y973) and for KIT (Y936; refs. 19, 46). In coimmunoprecipitation experiments we have shown interaction of overexpressed human FLT3-WT with human CBL-WT after FLT3 ligand stimulation. The interaction of CBL-70Z with FLT3-WT was even more pronounced, indicating that the interaction of mutant CBL and FLT3 might be more stable and might be very efficient in blocking CBL-WT from binding sites on activated FLT3 receptors. In vivo colocalization experiments confirmed colocalization of FLT3 and CBL in endosomal vesicles after FLT3 ligand stimulation of cells. It has been suggested that CBL ubiquitylates FLT3 (7). Here, we show that the presence of overexpressed CBLWT enhances down-regulation of FLT3 after binding of FLT3 ligand, providing direct evidence for a functional role of CBL in down-regulation of FLT3 activity. To analyze the transforming potential of CBL mutants we have chosen the IL-3 â€“dependent cell line BaF3, as it is a valuable model for the investigation of activated RTKs. We analyzed all human CBL mutations thus far detected and CBL- 70Z as a control. Only cells coexpressing FLT3-WT and a CBL deletion mutant were able to proliferate in the absence of IL-3. CBL point mutants coexpressed with FLT3WT showed enhanced survival, but no proliferative capacity in BaF3 cells. This finding is in contrast to the recent study of Sargin et al., in which the R420Q point mutation induced IL-3 â€“independent growth in myeloid 32D cells (7). This discrepancy may arise from the different cell systems used and highlights the need to analyze the phenotype of CBL mutations in primary cells. The addition of exogenous FLT3 ligand induced a rapid proliferative response to FLT3-WT CBL deletion mutant â€“ coexpressing cells. As AML blasts coexpress FLT3 ligand leading to an autocrine stimulation, this phenotype mimics the in vivo situation (47, 48). In the case of CBL point mutants only R420Q, but not G375 mutants, show significant growth in vitro in presence of FLT3 ligand. Coexpression of a CBL mutant autophosphorylates FLT3 and downstream molecules STAT5 and AKT. Additionally, CBL mutants themselves are constitutively phosphorylated, which points to a so far undescribed mechanism independent from the proposed dominant negative mechanism, in which CBL mutants block CBL-WT from binding sites at activated RTKs (47). Consistent with a dominant negative behavior of CBL mutants is the fact that we detected higher levels of FLT3 protein in FLT3/CBL mutant cells compared with control cells, as the increased stability of the FLT3 protein should be the result of a decreased degradation of FLT3. Analyzing the internalization rate of FLT3 in FLT3-WT and FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z cells revealed no difference in rate and speed of internalization; thus, early steps of endocytosis of FLT3 seem not to be affected by the presence of a CBL deletion mutant. This is in concert with a study from Jiang et al., in which late stages of endocytosis, but not recruitment of EGFR into coated pits, were affected by CBL-70Z (48). However, Sargin et al. found a slightly reduced internalization of FLT3 in the presence of CBL-70Z and CBLR420Q, so that this information is in conflict and needs to be clarified. Taken together, aberrant CBL transcripts occur in AML and are associated with core binding factor leukemias and 11q aberrations. The CBL deletion mutants show a transforming phenotype in BaF3 cells in the presence of FLT3, that resembles the phenotype seen in FLT3-activating mutations (FLT3-ITD, FLT3-TKD, FLT3-JM-PM). This new mechanism of activation through mutated negative-regulatory molecules of RTKs opens a door for treating patients with PTK inhibitors, who do not carry mutations in the RTK itself.  Acquired somatic uniparental disomy (UPD) is commonly observed in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN), or secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (sAML) and may point toward genes harboring mutations. Recurrent UPD11q led to identification of homozygous mutations in c-Cbl, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in attenuation of proliferative signals transduced by activated receptor tyrosine kinases. We examined the role and frequency of Cbl gene family mutations in MPN and related conditions.  Methods  We applied high-density SNP-A karyotyping to identify loss of heterozygosity of 11q in 442 patients with MDS, MDS/MPN, MPN, sAML evolved from these conditions, and primary AML. We sequenced c-Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-c in patients with or without corresponding UPD or deletions and correlated mutational status with clinical features and outcomes.  Results  We identified c-Cbl mutations in 5% and 9% of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and sAML, and also in CML blast crisis and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). Most mutations were homozygous and affected c-Cbl; mutations in Cbl-b were also found in patients with similar clinical features. Patients with Cbl family mutations showed poor prognosis, with a median survival of 5 months. Pathomorphologic features included monocytosis, monocytoid blasts, aberrant expression of phosphoSTAT5, and c-kit overexpression. Serial studies showed acquisition of c-Cbl mutations during malignant evolution.  Conclusion  Mutations in the Cbl family RING finger domain or linker sequence constitute important pathogenic lesions associated with not only preleukemic CMML, JMML, and other MPN, but also progression to AML, suggesting that impairment of degradation of activated tyrosine kinases constitutes an important cancer mechanism.  Go to: INTRODUCTION Mutations and genomic aberrations constitute key pathogenic lesions in myeloid malignancies. In primary acute myelogenous leukemia (pAML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), reciprocal translocations have enhanced our understanding of molecular pathogenesis, improved diagnosis and provided rational therapeutic targets. In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN), and AML evolved from MDS or MDS/MPN (secondary AML [sAML]), unbalanced chromosomal lesions predominate and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is of particular importance. LOH can arise either via hemizygous deletion, where a DNA segment is lost from one homolog while the other remains at one copy per cell, or by uniparental disomy (UPD), wherein the retained homolog is duplicated to preserve two total copies per cell at the locus. Thus, analysis of recurrent regions of LOH may point toward the presence of important mutations. Mutations seen in MDS and AML affect specific classes of genes and indicate general pathways of leukemia evolution.1 For example, mutations have been found in a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases, including c-Kit, c-Mpl, and Flt-3.2â€“4 Mutations also affect signal transduction genes such as Jak2 and NPM-1. tP53 constitutes an example of a proapoptotic tumor suppressor gene mutated in aggressive leukemias.5â€“7  Until recently, metaphase cytogenetics was applied for detection of chromosomal defects including deletions resulting in LOH. Using this technique, a number of invariant chromosomal abnormalities have been described and minimal affected regions delineated, pointing towards potentially pathogenic genes. Single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) â€“based cytogenetic analysis allows for better resolution of chromosomal defects, with identification of previously cryptic unbalanced lesions.8 In particular, SNP-A is able to identify UPD. We and others have recently shown that somatic UPD affecting various chromosomes can be found frequently in MDS, MDS/MPN, and sAML and have identified a number of recurrent areas.9â€“11 Initially, UPD9p was shown to lead to homozygosity of the Jak2 V617F mutation in MPN.12â€“14 Using SNP-A, we have demonstrated that other areas of UPD can also be associated with homozygous mutations, including UPD13p (Flt-3 ITD) and UPD1p (c-Mpl).15,16 Based on this paradigm, we recently identified a novel recurrent area of UPD at 11q, frequently present in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and AML evolved from atypical MDS/MPN, and through delineation of a commonly deleted region have identified mutations in c-Cbl.15 c-Cbl is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in degradation of activated receptor tyrosine kinases and other tyrosine kinases, including Src kinases. Consequently, mutations affecting the RING finger domain (RFD) may have a wide range of effects on proliferation regulation, crucial to both MPN and AML. In animal studies, c-Cbl knockout led to hyper-responsiveness to ligand stimulation and expansion of them in cell pools, overall resulting in a mild proliferative phenotype.17 However, RFD mutation knock-in in a c-Cblâˆ’/âˆ’ mouse model resulted in a myeloproliferative phenotype and leukemic evolution (W.Y. Langdon, personal communication, December 2008). In a transgenic MDS NUP98/HOX13 mouse model, progression to sAML with acquisition of RAS and c-Cbl mutations occurs frequently.18  We hypothesized that mutations inactivating oncogene degradation pathways may constitute a new class of molecular lesions in myeloid malignancies modifying current paradigms of leukemogenesis. We therefore investigated the presence of mutations in the Cbl family of E3 ubiqutin ligases in selected subtypes of malignant myeloid disorders and determined the phenotypic and functional features as well as clinical outcomes. Based on the study of these features we set out to discern the pathophysiologic principles of molecular dysfunction created by E3 ubiquitin ligase lesions.  Go to: METHODS Patients  Bone marrow aspirates were collected from 442 patients with MDS (n = 115), MDS/MPN (n = 98), MPN (n = 22), sAML (n = 110) evolved from these conditions, and pAML (n = 97) seen at Cleveland Clinic and Johns Hopkins Hospital between 2003 and 2008 (Appendix Table A1, online only). Informed consent for sample collection was obtained according to protocols approved by institutional review boards. Diagnosis was confirmed at each primary institution and assigned according to WHO classification criteria.19  Single Nuclotide Polymorphism Array Analysis  High-density Affymetrix SNP-A (250K and 6.0 arrays; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) were applied as a karyotyping platform to identify LOH on chromosome 11q. Lesions identified by SNP-A were compared to the Database of Genomic Variants20 (http://projects.tcag.ca/variation/) and an internal control series (n = 1,003) to exclude known copy number variations. To confirm all regions of LOH detected by 250K SNP-A, we repeated samples when possible on 6.0 arrays and analyzed using Genotyping Console version 2.0 (Affymetrix). Signal intensity was analyzed and SNP calls determined using Gene Chip Genotyping Analysis Software version 4.0 (GTYPE, Affymetrix). Copy number and areas of UPD were investigated using a Hidden Markov Model and CN Analyzer for Affymetrix GeneChip Mapping 250K arrays (CNAG version 3.0) as previously described.21  E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Mutational Screening  To screen patients for mutations in c-Cbl, Cbl-b, Cbl-c, and Hakai, direct genomic sequencing of all exons was performed (details of primers and conditions are available on request). For sequencing, 250 ng of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product, 3 Î¼mol/L original forward or reverse primer, 2 Î¼L Big Dye version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and 14.5 Î¼L deionized H2O were amplified under the following conditions: 95Â°C (2 minutes) followed by 25 cycles of 95Â°C (10 seconds), 50Â°C (5 seconds), and 60Â°C (4 minutes). Sequencing was performed as previously described.15 If a mutation was intronic, RNA was extracted by TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction performed for confirmation of splice variants.  Immunohistochemical Detection of pSTAT5  Staining was performed on a Benchmark XT platform (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ), according to the manufacturer's instructions, using mouse monoclonal antiphospho-STAT5a/b (Y694/99; Advantex BioReagents LLP, Conroe, TX) at 1:500 dilution. All stains were scored without knowledge of the clinical diagnosis or mutational status. Phospho-STAT5-positive staining (nMEG pSTAT5) was defined as previously reported.22,23 Images were obtained via digital microscopy using an Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus America, Melville, NY) equipped with either a UPlanFl 40Ã—/0.75 numeric aperture (NA) or a UPlanFl 100 Ã—/1.30 NA objective. Images were captured using a Dage-MTI Model DC330E charge-coupled device camera (Dage-MTI, Michigan City, IN) attached to the microscope with a U-TV1X-2 video adapter (Olympus America) and a 0.45Ã— camera coupler (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI).  Statistical Analysis  Overall survival was defined as the time a patient was diagnosed with a myeloid malignancy at Cleveland Clinic or Johns Hopkins to death or last known contact, and analyzed using Kaplan-Meier statistics and Cox's proportional hazards model. For comparison of the frequency of clinical features between Cbl family mutation and wild-type (WT), categoric variables were analyzed using Fisher's exact test.  Go to: RESULTS Detection of UPD11q Using SNP-A and Detection of c-Cbl Mutation  Previously, we identified homozygous c-Cbl mutations in patients with CMML and UPD11q.15 Using SNP-A karyotyping, we studied a large cohort of patients (n = 442) with MDS and related disorders, including JMML and CML blast crisis (CML-BC), to assess the frequency of this lesion within clinical subtypes. Three hundred one and 187 cases were examined by 250K and 6.0 arrays, respectively. Forty-six cases were analyzed using both arrays, yielding identical results. Based on the analysis of 1,003 controls, we determined the average size and location of nonclonal regions of autozygosity. All of these nonclonal regions were interstitial. For the purpose of this study, we have excluded all regions of autozygosity based on the size criteria (27 Mb) derived from controls. The remaining regions were confirmed by analysis of germ-line samples (nonclonal CD3+ lymphocytes) in 45 patients (Fig 1A). Regions of homozygosity found in both bone marrow and CD3+ fractions were excluded from further analyses. We confirmed UPD11q detected on 250K arrays by repeated analyses using ultra-high density Affymetrix 6.0 arrays and Genotyping Console version 2.0 software (Fig 1B). Among a total of 133 regions of somatic UPD on multiple chromosomes including 1, 4, 17, and 21, UPD11q was most common (n = 17). LOH can also result from deletions, and deletions involving 11q23.3 were found in 29 patients (Fig 1C). Sequencing c-Cbl revealed mutations in 13 cases (76%) of UPD11q. However, among patients with deletion11q, a c-Cbl mutation was found in only one case (CMML). We also analyzed patients without LOH11q to assess the frequency of heterozygous mutations and identified five cases (1.2%).  Fig 1 Fig 1 Detecting acquired, segmental uniparental disomy (UPD) using single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) technology. (A) SNP-A karyograms of both whole bone marrow (BM) cells and CD3+ lymphocytes of a patient show the somatic nature of acquired UPD in ... c-Cbl Mutations and Clinical Features  We sequenced all exons of c-Cbl; all mutations, except for 1 frame shift mutation in the tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain, were associated with the RFD or linker sequence, which are highly conserved among species. More importantly, 12 mutations in the RFD were located at or next to a cysteine residue (63%; Fig 2). The presence of each somatic mutation was confirmed by bidirectional DNA sequencing of multiple isolates and comparison against CD3+ sorted lymphocytes when possible.  Fig 2. Fig 2. Identification of variations in c-Cbl, Cbl-b and Cbl-c RING finger (RF) domain. Schematic representation shows the major domains of c-Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-c, primarily the tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain, linker sequence (L), RF domain, proline-rich ... In one case of a patient with MDS (refractory anemia subtype) and monosomy 7 who transformed to AML, SNP-A karyotyping revealed the UPD11q, yet after transformation to AML sequencing identified a c-Cbl mutation creating a novel splice site resulting in a longer transcript (Appendix Fig A1, online only). We also found a hemizygous mutation in the linker sequence in a CMML patient with a microdeletion of 11q23.3 previously undetected by metaphase cytogenetics (Appendix Fig A2, online only). Eleven mutations were found in CMML and similar forms of MDS/MPN unclassifiable either at or before the time of testing; 6 of these patients progressed to sAML (55%). In total, two (5%) of 38 patients with CMML, 10 (9%) of 110 with sAML, and one (1%) of 115 patients with MDS carried mutant c-Cbl (Appendix Table A2, online only). In addition, c-Cbl mutations were found in four (19%) of 21 patients with JMML and one (10%) of 10 with CML-BC.  Other Mutations and Nonsynonimous SNPs in Related E3 Ubiquitin Ligases  The Cbl family contains several other E3 ligases, including Cbl-b (3q) and Cbl-c (19q) as well as a novel member with high homology called Hakai (7q). Based on structural and functional similarities we hypothesized that these genes can also harbor mutations associated with similar clinical phenotypes. When we sequenced 12 patients with corresponding UPDs, no mutations were found. However, when we sequenced all patients in our cohort without c-Cbl mutations, we identified three with a heterozygous and one with a hemizygous Cbl-b mutation (Appendix Fig A3, online only) and three patients (one cell line) with a Cbl-c frame shift polymorphism with a single base insertion, all affecting the RFD (Fig 2). In addition, we identified 12 (7%) of 167 patients with myeloid malignancies harboring another rare nonsynonymous SNP in Cbl-c, also affecting the RFD (H405Y). The frequency of this SNP in the general population is less than 1% (data not shown).  Clinical Characteristics in Patients With Cbl Family Mutation  In order to identify the pathologic subtypes in which Cbl family member mutations may play a role, we systematically investigated a wide range of myeloid malignancies. They were most commonly associated with MDS/MPN subentities, including CMML and atypical MDS/MPN, and some cases of typical MDS. In addition, Cbl family mutations appear to be present in sAML with an antecedent history of MDS/MPN. Based on this distribution of c-Cbl mutations, we analyzed other related disease entities within MDS/MPN and MPN; we also identified c-Cbl mutations in JMML and in CML-BC (Appendix Table A2). This pattern suggests that c-Cbl mutations can be a characteristic feature of atypical MDS/MPN syndromes or serve as a second genetic hit facilitating malignant evolution. Our study demonstrates the ubiquitous nature of Cbl family mutations, in particular in the context of very circumscribed phenotypes of myelomonocytic neoplasms.  Several common clinical features were identified among 27 patients affected by the Cbl family of variants, including monoblast or monocyte proliferation (74%), splenomegaly (81%), and surface expression of c-kit on malignant cells (93%). Characteristic nuclear features included abnormal lobulation and hyperchromatic and raisinoid nuclei of megakaryocytes seen in patients with CMML (Appendix Fig A4, online only). By immunohistochemistry, c-Cbl mutant megakaryocyte nuclei displayed aberrant pSTAT5 staining (86%; Appendix Fig A4), while pSTAT5 was not expressed in patients without c-Cbl mutations. In three cases, pSTAT5 expression was not detected in specimens obtained before the mutation was present (Appendix Fig A4). The clinical phenotype of patients with Cbl-b mutations was not distinguishable from that of patients with c-Cbl mutations. The allelic pattern of Cbl family mutations plays an important role in disease phenotype in patients; in sAML eight (62%) of 13 c-Cbl family mutations were homozygous (Fig 3A).  Fig 3. Fig 3. Cbl family mutations in myeloid malignancies and unique clinical characteristics of patients with mutations. (A) Cbl family mutations are frequently observed in secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (sAML; 12%), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms ... To evaluate the impact of Cbl family mutations, we first compared mutant and WT cases on the basis of various clinical parameters (Table 1). In mutant cases, monocyte counts were significantly higher as compared with patients with WT Cbl family genes. A higher proportion of patients with c-Cbl mutations were treated with intense chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation, suggesting that these therapies were more frequently selected because of the aggressive biology of the Cbl mutation-associated disease. When we performed univariate analysis of survival impact of various clinical variables, significant differences in WBC, monocyte counts, disease risk, and the presence of Cbl family gene mutations (Table 2) were found. Chemotherapy was an adverse risk factor for survival, likely as it correlated with more advanced disease in multivariate analyses. The prognosis of patients with Cbl family mutations was poor, especially in those with homozygous mutations. The median overall survival was 5 months for all patients, with a significant difference of 1.7 months versus 20 months for patients with homozygous and heterozygous mutations, respectively (P = .04; Fig 3B). In multivariate analyses advanced disease (hazard ratio [HR], 5.64; 95% CI, 3.8 to 8.36) and Cbl family mutations (HR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.18 to 4.02; Table 3) were shown to be independent adverse factors for overall survival.  Table 1. Table 1. Comparison of Clinical Characteristics Between Wild-Type and Mutant Cbl Family Genes Table 2. Table 2. Univariate Analysis of Overall Survival in Clinical Variables Table 3. Table 3. Multivariate Analysis of Overall Survival in Clinical Variables Go to: DISCUSSION In leukemia, cytogenetic abnormalities identify underlying pathophysiology and carry enormous prognostic and therapeutic significance. Various examples of gain of function and inactivating mutations show that homologous recombination may lead to duplication of affected alleles.24 Consequently, areas of somatic UPD may point toward genes carrying putative pathogenic mutations. When high density SNP-A was applied as a karyotyping platform in a large number of patients with MDS and related disorders, we noted recurrent somatic UPD at chromosome 11q, particularly frequent in MDS/MPN. Commonly deleted region mapping and analysis of genes located within this region led us to hypothesize that c-Cbl may contain mutations. Sequencing of c-Cbl in patients affected by somatic UPD11q revealed RFD and linker sequence mutations present in patients with CMML, MDS/ MPN unclassifiable, and sAML derived from these conditions or MDS. We also found new mutations in Cbl-b with a clinical phenotype similar to that seen with c-Cbl RFD mutations. Consequently, our results imply that E3 ubiquitin ligases constitute a novel class of genes in whom mutations reflect a novel general mechanism of leukemogenesis. This notion is supported by the variety of pathomorphologic subentities of myeloid malignancies affected by mutations of the Cbl family. Moreover, a novel frame shift polymorphism was found in Cbl-c in patients with MDS/MPN. However, the relevance of this otherwise extremely rare polymorphism is not clear as the corresponding gene does not show significant expression in myeloid cells.  Cas-Br-M, a retrovirus, contains v-Cbl which corresponds to about one third of the murine c-Cbl gene and contains only the murine phosphotyrosine binding domain.25 This virus consistently induces a type of pre-B cell lymphoma in infected mice. The importance of c-Cbl in hematopoiesis has been previously demonstrated in knockout mice that show hyper-responsiveness to hematopoietic growth factors, expansion of the progenitor and stem cell pool, and mild myeloproliferative features.17 However, recent results obtained with an RFD knock-in in a c-Cblâˆ’/âˆ’ mouse model parallels the phenotype observed in patients; the mutant mouse demonstrated a severe myeloproliferative phenotype (W.Y. Langdon, personal communication). Indeed, in patients mutations were predominantly located in the RFD and affected structurally essential cysteines, possibly led to inactivation of RFD function by frame shift, or created novel splicing sites resulting in larger transcripts. In addition, c-Cbl mutations were homozygous or hemizygous, implying that the presence of a WT allele is protective. It is likely that mutations do not lead to the simple knockout of c-Cbl function. Rather, by affecting the RFD, they render it a proto-oncogene, consistent with the oncogenic properties of v-Cbl. Previously, mutations of c-Cbl have been described in a limited number of patients with AML, but neither their function nor their clinical phenotype could be delineated without a comprehensive study of corresponding karyotypes and clinical outcomes.26â€“28  c-Cbl is a member of the Cbl family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, which poly- or monoubiquitinate a number of important tyrosine kinases serving as important transduction elements of proliferative signals and activated tyrosine kinase receptors, including Flt-3, c-kit, and M-CSF.29,30 Consequently, inactivation of ubiquitination may lead to enhanced and prolonged signaling, a function which can explain the phenotype in patients (Fig 4). Based on this essential role of E3 ligases, we hypothesized that another Cbl family member, Cbl-b, may also be affected by mutations in myeloid malignancies. Sequencing of these genes in patients who did not harbor c-Cbl mutations revealed that these genes can also be affected by mutations leading to the inactivation of the RFD. These patients displayed a clinical phenotype analogous to those with c-Cbl mutations. The clinical features corresponding to c-Cbl mutations included monocytic features, aberrant and increased phosphorylation of pSTAT5, and monocytoid blasts. An increased frequency of mutations in patients with frank AML may argue either that c-Cbl mutations lead to an invariant progression to an aggressive phenotype, or that they constitute a second hit event frequently occurring in the context of atypical myeloproliferative disorders. In fact, unlike other reports that looked at patients with inv16, we found no mutation of Cbl family genes in de novo AML, including French-American-British type M4 or M5.28 Both theories are supported by the dismal prognosis of patients with Cbl family mutations. The close association of c-Cbl mutations with monocyte expansion, such as that seen in JMML, CMML, or sAML with monocytoid features, suggests a primary role of c-Cbl mutations in the pathogenesis of these diseases, while occurrence of c-Cbl mutations during evolution to AML in serially studied patients and the high proportion of cases with advanced leukemia affected by c-Cbl mutations argues for its auxiliary facilitator role.  Fig 4. Fig 4. Potential intracellular consequences of c-Cbl mutations. c-Cbl is a member of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl family, which poly- or monoubiquitinate a number of important receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), including Flt-3, c-kit, and CSF-1, for degradation. ... Taken together, our data suggests that Cbl family mutations constitute a novel class of pathogenic molecular lesions associated with a spectrum of myeloid malignancies characterized by myeloproliferative features and poor prognosis. Inactivation of the RFD, and thereby ubiquitination involved in downmodulation of proliferative signaling, constitutes a general mechanism of leukemogenesis likely present in a variety of malignancies.

Cbl-c gene is not known to be expressed in myeloid malignancies. â€ Cell line from a patient with secondary AML (sAML).  Despite the discovery of the p.V617F in JAK2, the molecular pathogenesis of some chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms remains unclear. Although very rare, different studies have identified CBL (Cas-Br-Murine ecotropic retroviral transforming sequence) mutations in V617FJAK2-negative patients, mainly located in the RING finger domain. In order to determine the frequency of CBL mutations in these diseases, we studied different regions of all CBL family genes (CBL, CBLB and CBLC) in a selected group of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. We also included V617FJAK2-positive patients to check whether mutations in CBL and JAK2 are mutually exclusive events.  Design and Methods  Using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography, we screened for mutations in CBL, CBLB and CBLC in a group of 172 V617FJAK2-negative and 232 V617FJAK2-positive patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms not selected for loss of heterozygosity. The effect on cell proliferation of the mutations detected was analyzed on a 32D(FLT3) cell model.  Results  An initial screening of all coding exons of CBL, CBLB and CBLC in 44 V617FJAK2-negative samples revealed two new CBL mutations (p.C416W in the RING finger domain and p.A678V in the proline-rich domain). Analyses performed on 128 additional V617FJAK2-negative and 232 V617FJAK2-positive samples detected three CBL changes (p.T402HfsX29, p.P417R and p.S675C in two cases) in four V617FJAK2-positive patients. None of these mutations was found in 200 control samples. Cell proliferation assays showed that all of the mutations promoted hypersensitivity to interleukin-3 in 32D(FLT3) cells.  Conclusions  Although mutations described to date have been found in the RING finger domain and in the linker region of CBL, we found a similar frequency of mutations in the proline-rich domain. In addition, we found CBL mutations in both V617FJAK2-positive (4/232; 1.7%) and negative (2/172; 1.2%) patients and all of them promoted hypersensitivity to interleukin-3.  Keywords: CBL, MPN, mutation analysis Go to: Introduction BCR-ABL1-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are a heterogeneous group of clonal hematologic malignancies characterized by abnormal proliferation and survival of one or more myeloid lineage cells. In some cases these diseases evolve to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These hematologic neoplasms include both classic MPN [essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF)] and atypical MPN (such as chronic eosinophilic leukemia, chronic neutrophilic leukemia, hypereosinophilic syndrome, mast cell disease and myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia, among others).1  In the late 1990s some genetic aberrations were described as molecular disease-causing events in these neoplasms, most of them via fusion genes resulting from reciprocal chromosomal translocations. Such fusions activate tyrosine kinases, playing a role similar to ABL1 in chronic myeloid leukemia.2,3 However these fusions are very rare and most of them have been reported in one or two cases worldwide.4  This situation changed in 2005 with the description of the p.V617F mutation (valine to phenylalanine in amino acid 617) in JAK2, found not only in classic MPN but also in a small number of atypical MPN and other myeloid neoplasms.5 Furthermore, it was found that most of the V617FJAK2-negative cases of PV had other transforming mutations in exon 12 of JAK2. Other gain-of-function mutations have also been described in genes coding for JAK-STAT receptors, such as MPL or EPOR in familial and sporadic cases of MPN.6â€“10 However, to date it is not known whether these mutations cause the full phenotype or whether they cooperate with other still uncharacterized mutations. Thus, there is still a significant proportion of patients in whom the molecular disease-causing event remains to be discovered.  Recently, the application of single nucleotide polymorphism and comparative genomic hybridization array technologies has led to the identification of new mutations in loss of heterozygosity regions affecting genes such as TET2,11 ASXL1,12 IKZF1,13 RUNX1,14 IDH1 and IDH2,15 EZH2,16 NF1,17 and CBL.18â€“23  CBL (11q23) codes for a protein of the Cbl family of E3-ubiquitin ligases (CBL, CBLB and CBLC) that acts as a negative regulator of some cell signaling pathways, by promoting the ubiquitination of several signaling molecules including some tyrosine kinases. CBL proteins share a common structure, with a highly conserved tyrosine kinase-binding domain in the amino-terminal region that determines substrate specificity. The catalytic E3-ubiquitin ligase activity resides in the RING finger domain, which is separated from the tyroskine kinase binding domain by a linker region. CBL and CBLB have two other domains that are not well conserved in CBLC: a proline-rich region involved in the recognition of SH3-proteins, and the carboxy-terminal UBA domain that interacts with ubiquitin molecules allowing dimer formation.24 CBL and CBLB play an important role in cell signaling in the majority of tissues, while CBLC activity seems to be restricted to epithelial cells.25â€“27  Over the last few years several groups have identified CBL mutations in different hematologic neoplasms, although most commonly in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)/MPN such as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.18â€“23,28â€“39 These changes cause the loss of E3-ubiquitin ligase activity, resulting in deregulation of downstream targets and an increase in cell proliferation rates. To our knowledge, CBL mutations seem to be mutually exclusive with other mutations frequently found in these diseases such as Ras mutations, FLT3-ITD or V617FJAK2. In this study we searched for mutations in CBL, CBLB and CBLC in a group of 172 V617FJAK2-negative and 232 V617FJAK2-positive MPN patients not selected for loss of heterozygosity, using a denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) method. Although most of the mutations described previously have been found in the RING finger domain and in the linker region of CBL, we found novel mutations also in the proline-rich domain, both in V617FJAK2-positive and -negative patients.  Go to: Design and Methods Samples  Blood samples were collected from 404 different Caucasian MPN patients without the BCR-ABL1 fusion from several hospitals from the north of Spain. Informed consent was obtained from individual patients and the study was approved by the internal Ethics Committee. The first series of patients included 44 with V617FJAK2-negative MPN (4 diagnosed as PV, 15 as ET, 4 as PMF and 21 as atypical MPN). Later, a second series of 128 V617FJAK2-negative MPN patients (16 PV, 81 ET and 31 PMF) and 232 V617FJAK2-positive MPN patients (69 PV, 149 ET and 14 PMF) were included. The presence/absence of V617FJAK2 mutation was determined in all patients by amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR).40 In addition, all 404 samples were negative for the presence of MPL p.W515 mutations by dHPLC. Human leukemia cell lines HEL, M07e, UKE-1 and SET-2 were also included in the study (Table 1).  Table 1. Table 1. Frequency of CBL mutations found in our series. Initial mutational screening by dHPLC included 20 healthy (no disease) samples used as controls in order to check the frequency of sequence changes observed in our population. For those fragments in which we found sequence variants in patients, we also included 180 additional control samples in order to rule out that the changes detected were population polymorphisms.  Cell lines  Cell proliferation assays were performed on 32Dcl3 (32D) murine myeloid cells (DSMZ N. ACC411) incubated at 37ÂºC in 5% CO2 and maintained in 90% RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 10 ng/mL murine interleukin-3 (Recombinant Mouse IL3, Cat #PMC0035, GibcoÂ®, Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK).  Plasmids  Plasmids with tagged human open reading frames in pCMV6-AC-GFP vectors were purchased from Origene Technologies (Cat #RG214069 for CBL, RG206047 for CBLB and RG205130 for CBLC). The tagged human cDNA clone for FLT3 was also purchased from Origene Technologies as pCMV6-Entry vector (Cat #RC211459) and subcloned into pCMV6-AC-RFP vector (Cat #PS100034). These pCMV6-AC vectors carried the NeoR gene. The pCMVâ€“HA ubiquitin vector was a gift from Dr. Francis Grand from Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory (Salisbury, UK).  Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography analysis  Genomic DNA was obtained from all the samples and amplified with GenomiPhi v2.0 (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) in order to obtain enough material for mutational screening. All mutations were confirmed using the original unamplified sample and no discrepancies were observed with whole-genome amplified DNA.  We designed primers with Primer341 to amplify all coding exons of the three screened genes (CBL, CBLB and CBLC) in flanking introns. For each fragment we also designed a mutant primer introducing a nucleotide change in the forward or reverse primer, depending on the corresponding melting profile, to create a control mutated fragment to validate each dHPLC assay. Melting profiles for PCR fragments, solvent gradients and temperature conditions were calculated by Navigatorâ„¢ Software v1.6.2 (Transgenomic Ltd., Omaha, NE, USA) and validated experimentally. All the analyses were performed on a WAVEÂ® 4500HT System (Transgenomic Ltd., Omaha, NE, USA) with a DNASepÂ® HT cartridge. Online Supplementary Table S1 contains a list of primers, the sizes of the amplified fragments and dHPLC conditions.  PCR reactions were performed with AmpliTaqâ„¢ Gold (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using standard protocols. After cycling, samples were subjected to several cycles of heating and cooling in order to create heteroduplex molecules to improve mutation detection by dHPLC. For each fragment, we sequenced two samples of each different elution profile. Results were analyzed with Mutation Surveyor v3.10 (SoftGenetics LLC, State College, PA, USA) and compared to genomic reference sequences (ENSG00000110395 for CBL, ENSG00000114423 for CBLB and ENSG00000142273 for CBLC).  All coding exons of CBL, CBLB and CBLC were initially analyzed in a group of 44 V617FJAK2-negative patients (4 PV, 4 PMF, 15 ET and 21 atypical MPN). In light of the results we analyzed the RING finger domain coding exons (exons 8 and 9 from CBL, exons 9 and 10 from CBLB and exons 7 and 8 from CBLC) in 128 V617FJAK2-negative (16 PV, 31 PMF, 81 ET) and in 232 V617FJAK2-positive MPN (69 PV, 14 PMF, 149 ET), as well as in human leukemia cell lines M07e, HEL, SET-2 and UKE-1. We also included CBL exon 12 in this extended analysis because we observed a p.A678V change in one sample from the initial series.  CBL exon 8 deletions  Some of the mutations described for CBL are large deletions involving exon 8 (RING finger domain)18,21â€“23,29,30,32,37,42 and the design of our mutation screening assay was not able to detect some of them. We, therefore, designed a new PCR assay with primers located in exon 7 and intron 9 (E7Fw: 5â€™-TCCTGATGGAC-GAAATCAGA-3â€™; E9-Rv: 5â€™-CTCACAATGGATTTTGCCAGT-3â€™) which would amplify a normal fragment of 989 bp. With this assay, any large deletion of exon 8 would be detected as a product of smaller size.  Site-directed mutagenesis  All missense mutations detected for each gene were functionally tested. Mutants p.R420Q (used as the control mutant), p.C416W, p.P417R, p.T402HfsX29, p.S675C and p.A678V for CBL; p.R462W for CBLB and p.Q419PfsX81, p.P435S and p.E392K for CBLC were obtained using the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, La Jolla, CA, USA) from the original plasmids.  Transfection  Transfections were performed with Amaxa NucleofectorÂ® Device II technology (Lonza Cologne GmbH, Basel, Switzerland) according to standard protocols. Cells of the 32D cell line in exponential growth were first transfected with FLT3 vector and maintained in medium until a second CBL/Ubi transfection. From the first transfection with FLT3 vector, cells were grown with Geneticin (G-418 sulfate, Cat #11811 GibcoÂ®, Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK) to select those clones that had incorporated the vector.  Cell proliferation assays  Proliferation analysis was performed with the CellTiter 96Â® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS, Ref #G3580, Promega Corp, Madison, WI, USA) according to standard protocols, comparing cells transfected with wild-type CBL (CBL, CBLB or CBLC in each case) with cells transfected with mutant CBL during 3 or 4 days, in triplicate. In each case we carried out four different experiments, also including 32D(FLT3) cells transfected with pCMV6-AC-GFP and mock-transfected 32D(FLT3) cells as controls. In all cases cells were supplemented with 10 ng/mL recombinant human FLT3-ligand (Cat #GF038, Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA) and with 10 ng/mL murine interleukin-3 (Recombinant Mouse IL3, Cat #PMC0035, GibcoÂ®, Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK). As the positive mutant control we used p.R420Q, a previously described CBL mutant with an effect on cell proliferation.28  Statistical analysis  Results from MTS proliferation assays were compared using the Studentâ€™s t-test implemented in UNStat (a free tool available at http://www.unav.es/departamento/genetica/unstat).  Go to: Results Mutational screening  In the initial screening of all coding exons of CBL, CBLB and CBLC in 44 patients with V617FJAK2-negative MPN we detected two missense changes not previously described in CBL (2/44; 4.5%). In this first series we also found three missense changes in CBLC described as single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs35457630, rs3208856, rs116023028) in the RING finger domain and proline-rich region. These changes were detected in samples from both patients and controls. No missense changes were detected in CBLB.  CBL changes (p.C416W or g.72251T&gt;G and p.A678V or g.81664C&gt;T) were found in patients diagnosed with atypical MPN, although the disease in the patient with p.A678V later evolved to CMML because of the development of dysplastic features. Whereas p.C416W affected the RING finger domain, like other mutations previously reported, p.A678V was located in exon 12, which codes for the proline-rich domain of CBL (see Figure 1). For this reason, we decided to include this exon in the analysis of CBL in an additional group of patients.  Figure 1. Figure 1. (A) CBL mutations described to date in myeloid malignancies. Mutations found in our analysis are colored in red. In contrast to other studies in which mutations were found in the linker region (LR) and the RING finger domain, we also found two novel changes ... When we analyzed exon 12 of CBL and the RING finger domains of CBL, CBLB and CBLC in the additional series of samples (128 V617FJAK2-negative and 232 V617FJAK2-positive patients), we found three CBL changes in four V617FJAK2-positive patients (4/232, 1.7%). The first one (detected in a patient with ET) was a not previously reported g.71955_71955A deletion in exon 8. This is a frameshift change that truncates the RING finger domain with loss of the proline-rich and UBA carboxy-terminal domains (p.T402HfsX29) (Figure 1). The second change was a substitution g.72253C&gt;G (p.P417R) in exon 9 in a patient diagnosed with PMF, also affecting the RING finger domain and previously identified in a patient with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.37 Finally, the third CBL mutation was a not previously reported g.81655C&gt;G substitution (p.S675C) in exon 12 (proline-rich region). Remarkably, this change was detected in two different V617FJAK2-positive patients, one with ET and the other with PV. None of the 200 control samples analyzed showed any of these changes. CBL exon 8 deletions were not observed in any case.  We also detected a not previously reported substitution (g.149486C&gt;T, p.R462W) in the RING finger domain of CBLB in a sample from a V617FJAK2-positive patient with PV (1/232; 0.4%). In CBLC, we detected one frameshift change (g.15702_15703insC, p.Q419PfsX81), in a patient with V617FJAK2-negative PV, which has been described as a polymorphism (rs66944506).  None of the cell lines included in these analyses (HEL, SET-2, UKE-1 and M07e) showed any CBL, CBLB or CBLC mutation.  CBL mutations promote hypersensitivity to interleukin-3 in 32D(FLT3) cells  A significantly higher number of cells was observed in 32D(FLT3) cells transfected with CBL mutants than with wild-type CBL (P&lt;0.05, Figure 2), grouping data from four independent cell proliferation assays. In addition, cells transfected with mutant vectors showed significantly higher proliferation rates in all cases (P&lt;0.05, Figure 2) and with stronger effects than those observed for the p.R420Q control mutation.  Figure 2. Figure 2. (A to F) All missense mutations detected in CBL were functionally tested. Left, results of cell proliferation assays corresponding to four different transfections for each mutation. Two transfection controls (cells mock-transfected and cells transfected ... By contrast, assays for p.R462W in CBLB and for p.Q419PfsX81, p.E392K and p.P435S in CBLC (Online Supplementary Figure S1) showed no significant differences (P&gt;0.05) in proliferation rates.  Go to: Discussion In the last few years the detection of regions with acquired loss of heterozygosity in some patients, mainly caused by acquired uniparental disomy, has allowed the identification of candidate genes that may be mutated in myeloid neoplasms. One of these genes is CBL, which codes for an E3-ubiquitin ligase protein. Cbl family proteins (CBL, CBLB and CBLC) play an important role as regulators of several signaling pathways promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of some RTK and CTK,44 many of which are involved in these diseases.4,45,46  The first CBL mutation identified was p.R420Q, affecting the RING finger domain in a patient with AML.28 Subsequently, other mutations have been reported with variable frequencies in myeloid neoplasms, affecting not only the RING finger domain but also the linker region (Figure 1). These events have been observed in 1â€“33% cases of secondary AML, 1â€“7% of MPN and 2â€“33% of MDS/MPN and AML,18â€“23,28â€“39 but their frequencies could be as high as 85â€“90% in patients with loss of heterozygosity in 11q.18â€“20,22,23,33 Some reports have also described that 7% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer have CBL mutations, so this gene can be mutated in other types of tumor.47 CBLB mutations and CBLC missense polymorphisms affecting the RING finger domain have also been described in myeloid neoplasms but at a lower frequency and with unknown effects.22,23,29  In this study we searched for mutations in CBL, CBLB and CBLC in a cohort of 404 V617FJAK2-negative and -positive MPN patients not selected for the presence of loss of heterozygosity in 11q. Our results show that CBL is mutated in V617FJAK2-negative MPN at a frequency similar to that previously reported (p.C416W and p.A678V; 1.2%, 2/172, Table 1).49 Both patients with mutations were initially diagnosed as having atypical MPN (2/21; 9.5%), although in one of them the disease evolved to CMML due to the development of dysplastic features. CMML is the disease with the highest frequency of CBL mutations reported to date.18â€“20,22,34 None of these mutations had been previously described and, notably, p.A678V was located in the proline-rich domain. In V617JAK2-positive MPN we found two mutations affecting the RING finger domain (p.T402HfsX29 in a patient with ET and p.P417R in a patient with PMF) and a recurrent change in the proline-rich domain (p.S675C in a patient with ET and in another one with PV) of CBL. Although TET2, ASXL1 and JAK2 mutations have been found concurrently,50 CBL mutations and V617FJAK2 seemed to be mutually exclusive events.13,21,26,51 However, we have found a similar frequency of CBL mutations in both V617FJAK2-positive and V617FJAK2-negative patients (Table 1), suggesting that the prevalence of CBL mutations could increase if V617FJAK2-positive patients were also included in CBL mutational studies. Unfortunately, we cannot know whether both mutations are in the same or in different clones or whether they are monoallelic or biallelic because of the type of sample available. None of the V617FJAK2-positive cell lines analyzed (HEL, SET-2 and UKE-1) showed CBL mutations that might help us to elucidate how both events could cooperate to drive the disease.43  In order to determine the effect of all these mutations on cell proliferation, in vitro functional assays were performed. All CBL mutations induced a hyperproliferative response to interleukin-3 in the 32D(FLT3) model, similar to that induced by the well-characterized p.R420Q mutation.28,31 This effect was not observed for the mutations detected in CBLB and CBLC. CBL was initially described as a putative tumor suppressor gene because of its negative regulatory function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Most of the mutations reported are located in conserved residues of the linker region and RING finger domain and could impair this regulatory function.44,46,52 RING finger domain mutations p.T402HfsX29, p.C416W and p.P417R described in this work also affect conserved residues of the protein (Figure 3) with a similar effect on the loss of activity of CBL.  Figure 3. Figure 3. Evolutionary conservation of the CBL regions in which mutations have been detected. Sequence comparison between humans (Homo sapiens) and other mammals (Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Pan troglodytes, Bos taurus, Macaca mulatta and Equus caballus) in ... Notably, we found two additional, novel mutations (one of them recurrent) affecting conserved residues in the pro-line-rich region (p.A678V and p.S675C, Figure 3) which also promote cell proliferation. In fact, we found similar frequencies of mutations in RING finger and proline-rich domains. The proline-rich region is essential for the interaction of CBL with the adaptor proteins (such as Grb2 and FRs2Î±) needed to maintain a stable attachment between CBL and its substrate,52 with proteins involved in the endocytosis of target receptors (such as SH3KBP1)46 and with several signaling proteins (such as the Src family).46  As in previous studies, we observed that mock-transfected cells showed greater growth than cells transfected with wild-type CBL, but less than cells transfected with mutant CBL. This fact is concordant with the proposal by some authors of a dominant negative effect of CBL mutant forms on endogenous wild-type CBL, making it unable to perform its negative regulatory function and promoting intracellular signaling and higher cell proliferation rates.18,26,27 However, in vivo studies have shown that the presence of gain-of-function mutants with a dominant effect over endogenous CBL is not enough to develop a myeloproliferative disease.18,26,27 A possible explanation for this phenomenon could be the activity of wild-type CBL as a positive regulator of cell growth contributing to the activation of pathways such as PI3K, Ras/MAPK and Src.52,53 Under normal conditions, the negative regulatory activity of CBL could mask its activity as a positive regulator, but the lack of E3-ubiquitin ligase activity could reveal its signaling enhancing activity.27 This could be the reason for the non-transforming effect of the p.R462W CBLB mutant in 32D(FLT3) cells. CBLB does not show the positive regulatory effects of CBL52 and perhaps the loss of its E3-ubiquitin ligase activity is not enough to promote cell proliferation. In fact, although CBLB activity seems to be similar to that of CBL in hematologic cells, very few cases of myeloid neoplasms with CBLB mutations have been reported.25,29  Finally, the results obtained in CBLC suggest that missense single nucleotide polymorphisms do not increase cell proliferation in our model. Wild-type CBLC induced higher proliferation rates in 32D(FLT3) cells than wild-type CBL in all assays (Online Supplementary Figure S1) possibly due to the absence of an inhibitory role of CBLC in hematologic cells.25,54,55  In conclusion, we have identified mutations in the proline-rich region of CBL in patients with MPN and also in V617FJAK2-positive patients. Although the entire CBL coding sequence has been investigated in some studies (by sequencing, not by dHPLC),18,19,22,32 most research in recent years has focused only on exons coding for the linker region and RING finger domain20,21,23,28,30,31,33â€“36,38 and in patients without other frequent genetic aberrations, such as mutations in JAK2.26 Proline-rich domain mutations (p.S675C and p.A678V) confer hypersensitivity to cytokines in the 32D(FLT3) model in a similar way to RING finger domain mutations (p.T402HfsX29, p.C416W and p.P427R), suggesting that they should also be considered in analyses of CBL. Although these events seem to be rare in MPN, our data highlight the importance of reevaluating the prevalence of CBL mutations in other regions of the gene in myeloid neoplasms. This could be of special interest in MDS/MPN because of the high incidence of CBL mutations in these diseases. In addition, further functional analyses of these genetic events could help us to understand the cellular functions of CBL and the role of the different protein domains. It is well known that CBL activity is mediated by the activation of different RTK, so the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (such as anti-FLT3) or other signal transduction inhibitors could also be effective in the treatment of patients with CBL mutations.27,32,56</td>\n",

       "      <td>Abstract Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is characterized by hypersensitivity to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). SHP2, NF-1, KRAS, and NRAS are mutated in JMML patients, leading to aberrant regulation of RAS signaling. A subset of JMML patients harbor CBL mutations associated with 11q acquired uniparental disomy. Many of these mutations are in the linker region and the RING finger of CBL, leading to a loss of E3 ligase activity. We investigated the mechanism by which CBL-Y371H, a linker region mutant, and CBL-C384R, a RING finger mutant, lead to enhanced GM-CSF signaling. Expression of CBL mutants in the TF-1 cell line resulted in enhanced survival in the absence of GM-CSF. Cells expressing CBL mutations displayed increased phosphorylation of GM-CSF receptor Î²c subunit in response to stimulation, although expression of total GM-CSFR Î²c was lower. This suggested enhanced kinase activity downstream of GM-CSFR. JAK2 and LYN kinase expression is elevated in CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutant cells, resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of CBL and S6 in response to GM-CSF stimulation. Incubation with the JAK2 inhibitor, TG101348, abolished the increased phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c in cells expressing CBL mutants, whereas treatment with the SRC kinase inhibitor dasatinib resulted in equalization of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation signal between wild type CBL and CBL mutant samples. Dasatinib treatment inhibited the elevated phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants. Our study indicates that CBL linker and RING finger mutants lead to enhanced GM-CSF signaling due to elevated kinase expression, which can be blocked using small molecule inhibitors targeting specific downstream pathways.  Keywords: Cytokine, E3 Ubiquitin Ligase, JAK Kinase, Signal Transduction, SRC, CBL, GM-CSF, Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia Go to: Introduction Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a cytokine that regulates the differentiation, survival, proliferation, and functional activation of granulocytes and monocytes in the myeloid lineage (1). In order to mediate its functional activity, GM-CSF binds to its receptor, the GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSFR),2 consisting of GM-CSR Î± and GM-CSFR Î² common (Î²c) subunits. The Î²c subunit of the receptor is shared by the IL-3 and IL-5 receptors. Î²c is the major signaling subunit and is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to cytokine stimulation. Î²c phosphorylation results in the recruitment of various effectors leading to activation of downstream signaling (2â€“4). GM-CSFR Î± is the major binding subunit, which dictates the binding specificity of the receptor complex for GM-CSF (2, 4, 5). The engagement of GM-CSFR by GM-CSF results in the formation of a dodecameric complex of GM-CSFÂ·GM-CSFR Î±Â·GM-CSFR Î²c, which leads to the trans-phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c-associated JAK2 kinases (6). The activated JAK2 kinases phosphorylate GM-CSFR Î²c tyrosine residues, allowing for the recruitment of various effectors and the activation of downstream signaling. GM-CSF stimulation results in the activation of the JAK-STAT, PI3K, and the RAS/MAPK pathways, contributing to GM-CSF-mediated differentiation, proliferation, and survival (reviewed in Refs. 1 and 4).  GM-CSF hypersensitivity is one of the defining characteristics of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). This disease is classified by the World Health Organization as a mixed myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease (7). JMML patients must show persistent monocytosis in the absence of the BCR-ABL oncogene (8). Genetic lesions deregulating the RAS signaling pathway have been identified to lead to JMML pathogenesis. 10â€“15% of JMML patients harbor mutations in neurofibromin protein (NF1) (9, 10), a GTPase-activating protein, which negatively regulates RAS by enhancing the hydrolysis of the active GTP-bound conformation of RAS to the inactive GDP-bound form (11). 35% of JMML patients have mutations in SHP2 (12â€“14), a protein-tyrosine phosphatase that positively regulates the RAS signaling pathway (15, 16). RAS-activating mutations account for another 20â€“25% of JMML-associated mutations (17â€“19). Several groups determined that a proportion of JMML patients have 11q uniparental disomy. CBL mutations were identified upon further analysis of the 11q uniparental disomy samples (20â€“22). The presence of NF1, SHP2, RAS, and CBL mutations are mutually exclusive, raising the question of how CBL mutations can lead to disease development.  CBL mutations have been identified in numerous other myeloid malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic, myeloproliferative, and mixed myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease (23â€“28). The majority of these mutations localize to the CBL linker region or the RING finger. CBL is a ubiquitin E3 ligase, which specifies target proteins for ubiquitination. The linker region and RING finger of CBL play very important roles in its E3 ligase functionality. The linker region contains two conserved tyrosine residues, Tyr-368 and Tyr-371, whose phosphorylation activates and positively regulates E3 ligase activity of CBL (29â€“31). The CBL RING finger is responsible for recruiting active E2s carrying an ubiquitin moiety, allowing for the transfer of ubiquitin to the target substrate (29, 32). Therefore, it is not surprising that mutations in the linker region and RING finger of CBL identified in myeloid malignancies result in a loss of E3 ligase activity.  JMML is associated with GM-CSF hypersensitivity; however, there is a lack of evidence that specifically examines the role of CBL downstream of the GM-CSF receptor and how JMML-associated CBL mutations may affect GM-CSF signaling. CBL is known to become phosphorylated downstream of the Î²c in response to stimulation by IL-3 (33, 34) and GM-CSF (35, 36). Furthermore, CBL associates with the Î²c subunit upon IL-5 stimulation (37). However, these studies do not directly address the role of CBL in GM-CSF signaling.  The objective of this study is to investigate how JMML-associated CBL mutations modulate GM-CSF signaling and lead to GM-CSF hypersensitivity. We expressed wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R in the human TF-1 hematopoietic cell line, which expresses the endogenous GM-CSF receptor at physiological levels (38). Upon GM-CSF stimulation, elevated phosphorylation of GM-CSF Î²c was observed, resulting from elevated JAK2 and LYN phosphorylation. Expression of CBL JMML mutants resulted in enhanced S6 phosphorylation and increased cell survival. Treatment with pharmacologic inhibitors delineated which proximal GM-CSF-dependent pathways are dependent on JAK2 and LYN activation. In summary, our data show that CBL JMML mutants result in enhanced GM-CSF signaling via modulation of JAK2 and LYN tyrosine kinases.  Go to: EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Constructs pMSCV-HA-CBL retroviral vectors were used to create JMML-associated CBL mutants. HA-tagged CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R were constructed using QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kits (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol.  Retrovirus Production HEK 293T cells were plated onto 10-cm dishes (Sarstedt) and grown to around 75% confluence. The 293T cells were transiently transfected with pSV (Gag and Pol proteins) and pVSV-G (envelope protein) and pMSCV-GFP retroviral vectors expressing HA-wild type CBL, HA-CBL-Y371H, or HA-CBL-C384R using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as directed in the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 4.5 Î¼g of pSV, 1.5 Î¼g of VSV-G, and 4.5 Î¼g of pMSCV-IRES-GFP-HA-CBL constructs were mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 in serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM H-21 for 20 min at room temperature. 293T cells were washed with serum-free DMEM H-21, and 4 ml of serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM H-21 was added to the cells. DNA-Lipofectamine 2000 mixture was added to the plated cells and incubated for 6 h at 37 Â°C. Transfection medium was removed from the cells, and 10 ml of RPMI 1640 medium with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum was added. Transfected 293T supernatant containing VSV-G pseudotyped virus carrying pMSCV-HA-CBL was collected at 48 and 72 h post-transfection.  Cell Lines and Culture TF-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 Î¼g of streptomycin/ml, and 2 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF. In order to stably express wild type and mutant CBL, TF-1 cells were infected with VSV-G pseudotyped retrovirus carrying wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R constructs. TF-1 cells were suspended in retroviral supernatant supplemented with 8 ng/ml Polybrene and centrifuged in 50-ml tubes at 12,000 rpm for 75 min. TF-1 cells were resuspended in fresh retroviral Polybrene solution and incubated overnight in 6-well dishes at 37 Â°C. A final round of spinoculation with fresh retroviral supernatant was performed on day 2. TF-1 cells were allowed to expand for 48 h. GFP-positive infected TF-1 cells expressing HA-CBL constructs were purified using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).  XTT Assay TF-1 cells were cytokine-depleted overnight, as described below. 2000 cells were transferred to each well of a 96-well plate in a final volume of 100 Î¼l of RPMI, 10% FCS with the indicated concentrations of GM-CSF. Plates were incubated at 37 Â°C for 48 h prior to the addition of 3 Î¼m phenazine methosulfate (Sigma) and 2 mg/ml XTT (Diagnostic Chemicals). The cells were incubated with the XTT/phenazine methosulfate solution for 6 h at 37 Â°C. The absorption of the reduction product at 450 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer plate reader.  Annexin V Flow Cytometric Analysis TF-1 cells were cytokine-depleted and maintained in cytokine-free media for 72 h. Cells were stained with annexin V-phycoerythrin (PE) according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Pharmingen). Stained cells were analyzed using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer.  Cytokine Deprivation, Stimulation, and Lysis TF-1 cells were washed three times in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), Hanks' balanced salts; depleted in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum overnight at 37 Â°C; and then stimulated with 0.5 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF. Proteasomal and lysosomal degradation was inhibited by incubation of cells with 30 Î¼m MG132 (Calbiochem/Millipore) and 100 Î¼m chloroquine (Sigma), respectively, for 2 h prior to stimulation. JAK2 and LYN kinase activity was inhibited by treatment with 2 m TG101348 (generously provided by Dr. R. Levine) for 4 h or with 0.1 m dasatinib (gift from Dr. D. Hedley) for 2 h, respectively. TF-1 cells were stimulated with 0.5 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF for the indicated times at 37 Â°C.  The cells were washed once in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), Hanks' balanced salts containing 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and supplemented with â€œcOmpleteâ€� protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). After 5 min on ice, the lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 Ã— g for 5 min at 4 Â°C.  Antibodies The 4G10 phosphotyrosine-specific monoclonal antibody and anti-ERK1/2 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology/Millipore. Anti-IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSFR Î²c N-20 (used for immunoblotting) and K-17 (used for immunoprecipitations)), anti-Shp2, and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies specific for phospho-JAK2 (Tyr-1007/1008), JAK2, phospho-SRC family (Tyr-416), phospho-Ser-235/236 S6, and Lynp56 were acquired from Cell Signaling Technologies. An anti-phospho STAT5a/b antibodies were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc./Invitrogen. Anti-STAT5 antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. The monoclonal 12CA5 anti-HA antibody was acquired from Roche Applied Science.  Immunoprecipitations Antibodies along with a 50-Î¼l volume of protein A or protein G-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to 2 mg of lysates for an overnight incubation at 4 Â°C. The beads were washed three times in ice-cold lysis buffer. The immune complexes were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm DTT. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane for Western blotting.  Western Blotting Following the electrophoretic transfer of proteins to PVDF membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), the membranes were blocked at room temperature with 2.5% BSA (w/v) or 5% nonfat dry milk (w/v) in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl) with Tween 20 for 1 h. Membranes were then incubated with an optimal concentration of the primary antibody in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 Â°C. Membranes were washed four times in TBST and incubated with the relevant HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 30â€“60 min. Membranes were washed four times in TBST and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence with autoradiographic film (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). For reprobing, membranes were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 0.1 m Î²-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 Â°C; rinsed twice in TBST; and blocked in 2.5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline prior to primary antibody incubation. Western blots were scanned and quantified using ImageJ software. Quantified Western blots are presented as mean Â± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test.  Go to: RESULTS Enhanced and Prolonged Phosphorylation of the GM-CSFR Î²c in CBL Mutant-expressing Cells GM-CSF hypersensitivity is one of the hallmark features of JMML (39). We utilized the TF-1 hematopoietic cell line to investigate the role of JMML-associated CBL mutations in vitro. TF-1 cells endogenously express the GM-CSF receptor Î± (GM-CSFRÎ±) and the IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSF receptor Î² common chain (GM-CSFR Î²c), and are responsive to GM-CSF. HA-tagged wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R mutants were stably expressed in TF-1 cells (Fig. 1A). All exogenous constructs showed high expression of CBL when compared with vector-infected cells (Fig. 1A). This is especially advantageous because studies have shown that expression of wild type CBL can rescue or mask the effects of CBL mutants (23, 40).  FIGURE 1. FIGURE 1. Enhanced phosphorylation of GM-CSF receptor Î²c upon expression of CBL mutants. A, lysates from parental TF-1 cells as well as from TF-1 cells expressing wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R were probed for CBL expression. IB, immunoblot. B ... Binding of GM-CSF to the GM-CSF receptor complex activates JAK2, leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c. In order to investigate the effects of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants on GM-CSF signaling, we examined the phosphorylation of the GM-CSFR Î²c after stimulation. TF-1 cells expressing wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R were cytokine-depleted and stimulated with GM-CSF. GM-CSFR Î²c was immunoprecipitated from lysates and immunoblotted with the 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Upon GM-CSF stimulation, cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 8 and 9) show enhanced phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c compared with the wild type CBL controls (lanes 2 and 3). Furthermore, prolonged phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c was observed in CBL mutant samples.  CBL plays an important role in stimulation-induced endocytosis, trafficking, and degradation of numerous tyrosine kinase (29, 32) and cytokine receptors (41, 42). To determine whether expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants has an effect on the expression of the GM-CSFR Î²c, as well as its GM-CSF induced degradation, lysates collected from GM-CSF-stimulated TF-1 cells were probed for GM-CSFR Î²c. Because it is likely that CBL-Y371H (23, 30) and CBL-C384R (43) mutations result in a loss of CBL E3 ligase activity, GM-CSFR Î²c levels were expected to be higher in mutant CBL-expressing cells. Surprisingly, expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R (Fig. 2A, lanes 4â€“9) results in a decrease in GM-CSFR Î²c compared with wild type CBL (lanes 1â€“3)-expressing cells at 0, 10, and 60 min (Fig. 2B). However, it is important to note that GM-CSFR Î²c expression decreased after GM-CSF stimulation in wild type and mutant CBL-expressing cells at comparable rates. These results indicate that although expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R results in an overall decreased expression of GM-CSFR Î²c, the degradation of the receptor poststimulation appears not to be disrupted.  FIGURE 2. FIGURE 2. TF-1 cells expressing CBL mutants have lower expression levels of GM-CSFR Î²c. Lysates were collected as described in the legend to Fig. 1. A, immunoblotting (IB) was performed with GM-CSFR Î²c-specific antibody. Blots were reprobed for ... Elevated Levels of JAK2 Kinase in CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing TF-1 Cells Upon binding of GM-CSF to GM-CSFRÎ±, a GM-CSFR Î²c homodimer is recruited (6), bringing the Î²c-associated JAK2 kinase (44, 45) into close proximity, allowing transphosphorylation and subsequent activation of the kinase. Activation of JAK2 is essential for downstream GM-CSF signaling (46, 47). The enhanced and prolonged phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c, along with a decrease in the overall expression of the receptor in CBL mutant-expressing cells may be indicative of elevated kinase activity downstream of GM-CSFR Î²c. Because JAK2 is the main tyrosine kinase downstream of GM-CSFR, the GM-CSF-induced activation of JAK2 was assessed. TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R displayed elevated levels of phosphorylated JAK2 upon GM-CSF stimulation (Fig. 3A, top, lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 8 and 9), compared with the wild type CBL controls (lanes 2 and 3). Reprobing for total JAK2, revealed that the observed enhancement of the phospho-JAK2 signal may be due to an increase in the expression of JAK2 in CBL mutant-expressing cells (Fig. 3, A (middle, lanes 4â€“9) and B).  FIGURE 3. FIGURE 3. Expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants results in elevated JAK2. A, lysates collected from TF-1 cells expressing wild type and CBL mutants were probed for phospho-Tyr-1007/1008 JAK2 and reprobed for total JAK2 and tubulin. B, blots were quantified ... Linker and RING finger mutations disrupt the E3 ligase activity of CBL (29, 31, 32). Such loss of E3 ligase activity has been shown to result in a significant decrease in the EPO-induced ubiquitination of JAK2 (23). In order to determine whether the increase in total JAK2 in CBL mutant expressing cell lines was due to compromised ubiquitination and degradation of the kinase, TF-1 cells expressing wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R were treated with proteasomal (MG-132) and lysosomal (chloroquine) inhibitors prior to stimulation. Inhibition of proteasomal and lysosomal degradation stabilized JAK2 to comparable levels in all three cell lines (Fig. 3C, middle). These results indicate that the expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants affects the degradation of JAK2, leading to elevated levels, which in turn contribute to increased JAK2 phosphorylation and potentially signaling in response to GM-CSF stimulation.  Increased Expression of LYN Kinase in CBL Mutant Cells Although JAK2 is the primary kinase activated downstream of GM-CSF receptor, members of the SRC family kinase are stimulated in response to GM-CSF (48â€“50). Specifically, LYN has been shown to directly associate with GM-CSFR Î²c (51) and to play an important role in mediating the anti-apoptotic effects of GM-CSF in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (49, 52). LYN also associates with GM-CSFRÎ± and is involved in the survival signal required for factor-independent growth of cells expressing the FIÎ” GM-CSFR Î²c mutant (48). Considering that TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R show enhanced survival while exhibiting lower expression of GM-CSFR Î²c, we wanted to determine whether LYN phosphorylation and/or expression was altered in CBL mutant-expressing cells. Lysates collected from GM-CSF-stimulated cells were probed with an antibody specific for pY396-LYN, residing in a phosphorylated motif within the LYN activation loop. Increased LYN phosphorylation was observed in cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants (Fig. 4A, top, lanes 4â€“9), compared with those expressing wild type CBL (lanes 1â€“3). Reprobing for total LYN revealed that CBL mutant cells have increased levels of LYN (p56) (Fig. 4, A (middle, lanes 4â€“9) and B). This observed increase in LYN expression leads to elevated LYN phosphorylation, which may contribute to the enhanced survival of CBL mutant TF-1 cells.  FIGURE 4. FIGURE 4. Increased expression of LYN kinase in CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutant TF-1 cells. A, whole cell lysates collected from TF-1 cells expressing CBL-WT and CBL mutants were immunoblotted with antibodies specific for Tyr(P)-396-LYN. Blots were reprobed for ... Similar to JAK2, treatment with MG-132 and chloroquine stabilized total LYN levels to comparable levels in wild type and mutant cells, indicating that the increase in LYN levels is probably due to the loss of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the CBL mutants (Fig. 4C).  Expression of CBL Mutants Results in Constitutive S6 Phosphorylation and Enhanced Factor-free Survival Investigation of signaling effectors further downstream of the GM-CSF receptor revealed enhanced phosphorylation of SHP2 in CBL mutant-expressing cells relative to wild type CBL controls (Fig. 5A). Constitutive phosphorylation of S6 in TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R, compared with wild type CBL-expressing controls (Fig. 5B), was also observed. No significant differences were observed in the phosphorylation of STAT5 or ERK1/2 (Fig. 5C) between wild type CBL- and mutant CBL-expressing TF-1 cells after GM-CSF stimulation.  FIGURE 5. FIGURE 5. Expression of CBL mutants results in constitutive phosphorylation of S6 and enhanced survival of TF-1 cells. A, SHP2 immunoprecipitations (IP) were performed on lysates collected from TF-1 cells expressing CBL-WT, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R, which were ... XTT assays were performed to determine whether the expression of the CBL linker and RING finger mutants results in enhanced survival and growth. TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants displayed enhanced survival in the absence of GM-CSF relative to cells expressing wild type CBL (Fig. 5D). The increase in the survival of the mutant-expressing cells decreases with increasing concentration of GM-CSF. Cell counting assays were also performed to confirm these results (data not shown). To determine whether the increase in survival was due to a decrease in apoptosis, annexin V staining was performed on cytokine-deprived wild type and mutant CBL-expressing cells. There was a decrease in annexin V-positive TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H relative to wild type CBL-expressing controls, whereas the proportion of annexin V-positive CBL-C384R-expressing cells was comparable with wild type CBL controls (Fig. 5E). These results indicate that JMML-associated CBL mutations result in enhanced survival of TF-1 cells at low doses of GM-CSF.  Constitutive and Enhanced Phosphorylation of CBL Mutants Is Dependent on an SRC Family Kinase CBL is phosphorylated downstream of numerous oncogenic protein-tyrosine kinases (BCR/ABL and v-SRC), receptor tyrosine kinases (PDGF-R, FLT-3, and c-KIT), and cytokine receptors (TPO and EPO) (reviewed in Ref. 53). For example, CBL is tyrosine-phosphorylated downstream of the Î²c chain in response to IL-3 (33, 34) and GM-CSF (35, 36).  The carboxyl-terminal region of CBL contains three major tyrosine phosphorylation sites, Tyr-700, Tyr-731, and Tyr-774 (54). Phosphorylation of these tyrosines leads to the recruitment of SRC homology 2 domain-containing effectors. Phosphorylated Tyr-700 of CBL binds the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, VAV (55). Phosphorylated Tyr-731 acts as the binding site for the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (56, 57), and members of the CRK adaptor protein family have been shown to bind both phosphorylated Tyr-700 and Tyr-774 (58â€“60). Downstream pathways mediated by CBL tyrosine phosphorylation sites play an important role in CBL-mediated signaling. Linker region mutations of CBL have been shown to lead to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL in Ba/F3-FLT3 cells (24).  We were interested in determining whether expression of the linker region Y371H and the RING finger C384R mutations would result in altered CBL tyrosine phosphorylation. CBL was immunoprecipitated from wild type and mutant CBL TF-1 lysates, and phosphorylation was assessed by Tyr(P) immunoblotting (Fig. 6). CBL-Y371H (lanes 4â€“6) and CBL-C384R (lanes 7â€“9) were highly phosphorylated compared with CBL wild type controls (lanes 1â€“3). Both CBL mutants showed constitutive phosphorylation in the absence of GM-CSF stimulation (lanes 4 and 7).  FIGURE 6. FIGURE 6. Dasatinib treatment abolishes the enhanced phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R. TF-1 cells expressing WT and mutant CBL were incubated with dasatinib and TG101348 for 2 and 4 h, respectively, prior to GM-CSF stimulation. Cells were lysed, and HA ... Although numerous members of the SRC family kinases, including LYN (61â€“63), are capable of phosphorylating CBL, there is evidence that Janus kinase family members may also target CBL for tyrosine phosphorylation (64). To determine whether inhibition of JAK2 or SRC family kinases could abolish the enhanced and constitutive phosphorylation of CBL, TF-1 cells expressing wild type and mutant CBL were treated with either the JAK2-specific inhibitor TG101348 or the SRC family kinase inhibitor dasatinib prior to stimulation. The constitutive and enhanced phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants (lanes 22â€“27) persisted in TG101348-treated samples (Fig. 6), whereas pretreatment with dasatinib abolished the elevated phosphorylation of CBL mutants (lanes 13â€“18) to levels comparable with wild type CBL controls (lanes 10â€“12). These results indicate that downstream of the GM-CSF receptor, CBL is phosphorylated by a SRC family kinase, potentially LYN, and mutations in the linker region or the RING finger domain of CBL lead to not only enhanced but also constitutive phosphorylation of CBL.  TG101348-mediated Inhibition of Enhanced Phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c in CBL Mutant-expressing Cells We were interested in determining how the inhibition of JAK2 or SRC family kinases downstream of GM-CSFR would modulate the elevated phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c observed in CBL mutant-expressing cells (Figs. 1B and â€‹and7,7, lanes 1â€“9). TF-1 cells were treated with TG101348 and dasatinib, alone or in combination, prior to stimulation and subsequent GM-CSFR Î²c immunoprecipitation. TG101348 treatment resulted in a significant inhibition of GM-CSF-induced phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c in both wild type CBL- and CBL mutant-expressing cells, resulting in an equally down-modulated level of the phosphorylated receptor (Fig. 7, lanes 10â€“18). This was expected, because JAK2 is known to be the kinase responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of the GM-CSFR Î²c in response to stimulation (47, 65, 66).  FIGURE 7. FIGURE 7. Inhibition of JAK2 activity via treatment with TG101348 abolishes the enhanced phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î² in CBL mutant-expressing cells. TF-1 cells expressing WT-CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R were cytokine-depleted and treated with 2 mm TG101348 ... Interestingly, inhibition of SRC family kinases did not result in the inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation, but it did result in an equivalent level of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation in wild type CBL and CBL mutant samples (Fig. 7, lanes 19â€“27). Treatment with both TG101348 and dasatinib inhibited GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation (Fig. 7, lanes 28â€“36) to similar levels observed in samples treated with only TG101348.  Go to: DISCUSSION Hypersensitivity to GM-CSF is one of the defining characteristics of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Until recently, genes mutated in JMML patients (NF1, SHP2, NRAS, and KRAS) were directly involved in the RAS signaling pathway. The Loh and Maciejewski groups (20â€“22) found that 10â€“15% of JMML patients have mutations in CBL and that these mutations are associated with acquired uniparental disomy. The majority of CBL mutations identified clustered in the linker region and RING finger, both of which play an important role in the E3 ligase activity of CBL. The identification of these JMML-associated CBL mutations raised a number of questions about the role of CBL downstream of GM-CSF receptor, whether CBL is involved in RAS signaling downstream of GM-CSFR, and how mutations in CBL can lead to hypersensitivity to GM-CSF. In order to address these questions, we utilized the TF-1 hematopoietic cell line, which is GM-CSF-responsive (38) and has a low endogenous CBL expression. To examine the functional consequences of CBL linker region mutations, we expressed CBL-Y371H linker and CBL-C384R RING finger mutants, because these are two of the most common CBL mutations observed in JMML patients (21, 22).  We found that expression of these CBL mutants in GM-CSF-stimulated TF-1 cells leads to enhanced and prolonged phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c, which occurred concurrently with elevated expression of both JAK2 and LYN. Assessment of downstream signaling revealed enhanced phosphorylation of S6 in CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing cells relative to wild type CBL controls. TF-1 cells expressing CBL mutations showed enhanced survival in the absence of GM-CSF, and specifically in the case of CBL-Y371H-expressing cells, this is probably due to a decrease in induction of apoptosis. We also observed elevated and constitutive phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants, which was inhibited upon treatment with dasatinib, an SRC family kinase inhibitor. Interestingly, treatment with dasatinib also led to equalization of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation between wild type CBL- and CBL mutant-expressing cells. However, inhibition of JAK2 activity by TG101348 resulted in complete inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation in CBL mutant and wild type CBL control cells.  Expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants results in prolonged and elevated receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, which supports the observed enhancement in survival (67). Martinez-Moczygemba and Huston (37, 68), using the IL-5 receptor as a model for Î²c subunit-sharing cytokine receptors (IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSF), demonstrated that increased Î²c subunit ubiquitination is observed after stimulation. This ubiquitination event leads to the proteasomal degradation of the cytoplasmic tail of the Î²c subunit, which attenuates downstream signaling (37, 68). They also found that the ubiquitination of the Î²c subunit may be mediated by CBL, because the E3 ligase was co-immunoprecipitated with the Î²c subunit. The loss of E3 ligase activity of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants may prevent GM-CSFR Î²c ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the cytoplasmic region of the receptor and culminate in the observed enhancement of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation and elevated levels of JAK2. However, this is unlikely, because we have observed total levels of GM-CSFR Î²c to be lower in CBL mutant cells. Alternatively, increased JAK2 and LYN expression could be correlated with a negative feedback loop that down-regulates GM-CSFR Î²c levels in TF-1 cells. The ubiquitination of Î²c in response to IL-5 stimulation is dependent on JAK2 activity (68, 69). In CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing cells, the enhanced JAK2 activity can potentially lead to increased ubiquitination of the Î²c by other ubiquitin ligases, resulting in decreased overall expression of the receptor subunit.  JAK2 is also regulated via CBL-mediated ubiquitination (23, 70). The expression of CBL mutants Y371H and C384R may result in decreased ubiquitination of JAK2, culminating in elevated levels of JAK2 as well as enhanced JAK2-mediated phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c. We found that in CBL mutant cells, there was elevated expression of JAK2 kinase, which was abolished upon treatment with proteasomal and lysosomal inhibitors.  Similar to JAK2, several members of the SRC family kinases (71), including LYN, have been shown to be ubiquitinated (72) by CBL (73, 74). The enhanced expression of LYN in TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R indicates that, downstream of GM-CSFR, CBL is responsible for LYN ubiquitination. LYN mediates the tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL downstream of Î²1 integrin (61), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (62, 75), and the B-cell antigen receptor (63, 76). We have observed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants, which is abolished upon treatment with the SRC family kinase inhibitor dasatinib. This confirms that LYN is a kinase responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL downstream of the GM-CSFR, and the enhanced phosphorylation of CBL mutants may be a functional consequence of the elevated levels of LYN in CBL mutant-expressing cells.  Phosphorylation of CBL Tyr-731 leads to the activation of the PI3K pathway via recruitment of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (54, 56). The Corey group (62, 77) has shown that LYN couples to the PI3K pathway in a CBL-dependent manner, whereby activated LYN binds and phosphorylates CBL, allowing for the recruitment of p85 to the complex. LYN also activates the PI3K pathway downstream of GM-CSFR Î± (48), promoting cell survival. We have shown that expression of CBL JMML mutants defective in E3 ubiquitin ligase activity leads to aberrant regulation of LYN downstream of GM-CSFR, which ultimately leads to constitutive and enhanced phosphorylation of S6, suggesting elevated PI3K pathway activity. Interestingly, basal activation of S6 has been observed in mononuclear cells isolated from JMML patients (78). Furthermore, in the absence of LYN, the antiapoptotic effects of GM-CSF are abolished (49, 52). At low concentrations of GM-CSF, the signaling pathways activated downstream of the receptor lead to cell survival only, whereas stimulation with higher doses results in cell proliferation and cell survival (79). We have shown that expression of CBL mutants results in enhanced survival, especially at low doses, or in the complete absence of GM-CSF in TF-1 cells. These data suggest that CBL linker and RING finger mutants lower the threshold concentration of GM-CSF required to induce cell survival. Together, these results suggest that in CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing cells, the modulation of the PI3-K pathway due to the increase in LYN levels may be contributing to the observed enhancement of survival in the absence of GM-CSF.  The mechanism by which these mutations lead to elevated GM-CSF signaling and enhanced survival depends on the role of CBL as both an E3 ligase and an adaptor protein. CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants compromise the E3 ligase activity of CBL. We have shown that these loss-of-function mutations lead to increased levels of JAK2 and LYN kinases downstream of the GM-CSFR, potentially due to loss of ubiquitination of the kinases or to the inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c ubiquitination and cytoplasmic domain degradation. These events contribute to the elevated levels of GM-CSF signaling observed in CBL mutant-expressing TF-1 cells. Sanada et al. (23) have shown that Cblâˆ’/âˆ’ LSK cells show a mild cytokine hypersensitivity, but transformation of Cblâˆ’/âˆ’ LSK cells with Cbl linker region mutants significantly enhances the cytokine hypersensitivity, indicating a gain-of-function of the mutants that cannot be ascribed to a simple loss of CBL E3 ligase activity. Inhibition of Cbl-b function by mutant Cbl has been proposed as a possible mechanism (80, 81). However, it is possible that functionality of CBL as an adaptor protein may be contributing to the gain of function of the mutants. Our group, as well as others, has shown that expression of CBL linker and RING finger mutants results in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL (24, 81, 82). This increase in CBL phosphorylation culminates in enhanced PI3K and RAS pathway activation. We found that treatment with dasatinib results in loss of CBL phosphorylation. Interestingly, dasatinib treatment equalized GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation in wild type- and CBL mutant-expressing TF-1 cells. Therefore, dasatinib treatment may decouple the gain-of-function capacity of CBL mutants from the loss of E3 ligase activity. Considering that treatment with JAK2 inhibitor, TG101348, results in complete inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation, dasatinib may provide a treatment option for the enhanced signaling driven by CBL gain-of-function mutations.  Prior studies have shown that expression of CBL linker region and RING finger mutants inhibits stimulation-induced ubiquitination of the EGF-R (23, 29), FLT3, c-KIT, and JAK2 (downstream of EPO-R) (23). Niemeyer et al. (40) have shown that expression of CBL linker region mutants in Ba/F3-EPO-R cells results in an enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, AKT, and S6. In Ba/F3 cells expressing the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase, expression of CBL-Y371 mutants leads to elevated FLT3 phosphorylation as well as AKT and STAT5 (24). Although these studies are useful to probe how CBL mutations perturb FLT3 signaling in AML, no studies have examined the role of CBL JMML mutations in GM-CSF-dependent signaling pathways to date. Our analysis reveals that expression of CBL-Y371H or CBL-C384R in TF-1 cells generates GM-CSF hypersensitivity that affects proximal steps in receptor activation, including GM-CSFR Î²c, JAK2, and LYN coupling to PI3K activation. Unlike with the Ba/F3 results, we failed to observe effects on ERK1/2 or STAT5 activation. Whether this is a function of the unique receptor systems or distinct cell lines remains to be determined.  In conclusion, these studies have confirmed that CBL plays a negative regulatory role downstream of GM-CSFR. We have shown that the enhancement of GM-CSF signaling observed upon loss of CBL E3 ligase activity is due to increased stability of JAK2 and LYN. These results provide in vitro support for further investigation into the applicability of JAK2 and SRC family kinase inhibitors for use in treatment of myeloid malignancies associated with CBL linker region and RING finger mutations. Oncogenic mutations in the monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors, but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study, we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability, binding, and activity. We found that recurrent, homozygous, and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2, by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and, to a lesser extent, with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding, whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity, and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL, driver mutations, protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations), the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability, interactions, and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures, their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2, 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity, stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5, 6). Strikingly, proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain (TKBD), a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain, while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time, since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain, they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9, 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK, CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein, thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study, substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach, which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability, binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely, we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent, homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.  Go to: Materials and Methods Computational modeling and analysis  Mapping of CBL mutations The COSMIC database (15) stores data on somatic cancer mutations and integrates the experimental data from full-genome sequencing studies. We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations), zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations), types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition, all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a â€œRandomâ€� missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures, we obtained 2,102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL), (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S), (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13), CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%, the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Ã…. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Ã… from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40,000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  Î”Gbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î”Gbindmut-Î”GbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î±Î”Î”Evdw+Î²Î”Î”Gsolv+Î³Î”SAmut+ÎµÎ”Î”GBM+Î»Î”Î”GFD+Î´ (3) Here Î”Î”Evdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and Î”Î”Gsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. Î”SAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. Î”Î”GBM and Î”Î”GFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX, respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation, optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( Î”Gfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( Î”GfoldWT).  Î”Î”Gfold=Î”Gfoldmut-Î”GfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27), the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). (See Supplementary Methods for more information.)  Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs, described above, were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T, the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega, Madison, WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15, A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15, and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp., Madison, WI), incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change, and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins, cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbeccoâ€™s PBS-containing 200 Î¼M sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals, Fairlawn, NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO], 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors [Complete tabsÂ®, Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16,000 Ã— g for 15 m at 4 Â°C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA). For immunoblotting, 20Î¼g of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue, 0.3573 M Î²-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations, 150 Î¼g of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer, then resuspended in 2X loading buffer, boiled for 5 m, then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman, Sanford, MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins, the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling), rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase, (clone 3F10; Roche), rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc., South Plainfield, NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc., Long Beach, CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination, in the presence of each CBL mutation, was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes, Î”Î”Gfold, upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35, 36). Namely, the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal molâˆ’1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations, recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value â‰ª 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1, Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall, the form of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the Î”Î”Gfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value â‰ª 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However, it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger, as we show later, this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (Î”Î”Gfold) and binding (Î”Î”Gbind) free energy changes for Single, Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V, G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements, whereas other mutations (S376F, Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example, L405P located in the middle of an Î±-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations, especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters, compared to random mutations (p-value â‰ª 0.01, Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations, therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value â‰ª 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state, consistent with experiments, we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability, recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B, S1 and Table S2). Importantly, cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next, all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations, Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them, several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example, the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal molâˆ’1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10, 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family, it strongly interacts with the Q92, W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q, R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation, there are 49 heterozygous (â€œHeteroâ€�) and 27 homozygous (â€œHomoâ€�) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall, we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 â€“ 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 â€“ 0.003) (Fig. 2B, Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6, 38, 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL, then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele, it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed, human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status, trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples, and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods, Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A, in the presence of wild-type CBL, activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type, CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells, predicted changes in stability (Î”Î”Gfold kcal molâˆ’1), binding affinity (Î”Î”Gbind kcal molâˆ’1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging, attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R, H398Q, Y371H, K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R, H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand, the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This, in turn, could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover, K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B,C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally, the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V, V430M, P428L, Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this, the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific, we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells, transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this, the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells, the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example, the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models, whereas V430M, consistent with experimental data, had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally, the third group constituted mutations (L399V, G375P, P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this, there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly, mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast, the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and Î”Î”Gfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed, the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of Î”Î”Gfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5, changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison, several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy, they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52, with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 (A) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (exponential model) and maximal predicted changes in stability. (B) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (linear model) and predicted changes in binding affinity of pCBL-E2-S state. ... There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations, (30â€“33, 41) and some of them use structural features (31, 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However, all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5, all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEANâ€™s score (R=0.58, Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural, foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand, thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites, which might not be energetically optimal (36, 42). In tumorigenesis, protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level, but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43, 44). However, the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein, here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies, which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation, we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity), while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study, about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity, while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models, we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However, these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed, many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations, but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly, the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene, their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47), where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48, 49). Importantly, all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact, the correlation between Î”Î”Gfold and Î”Î”Gbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 â€“ 0.48 depending on the CBL state, p-value &lt; 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants, one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However, as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes, this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall, our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity, of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases, of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However, there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1), CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand, as shown in our study and in other studies, cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL, so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies, understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed, targeted therapies. Our approach, which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest, emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Abstract Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is characterized by hypersensitivity to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). SHP2, NF-1, KRAS, and NRAS are mutated in JMML patients, leading to aberrant regulation of RAS signaling. A subset of JMML patients harbor CBL mutations associated with 11q acquired uniparental disomy. Many of these mutations are in the linker region and the RING finger of CBL, leading to a loss of E3 ligase activity. We investigated the mechanism by which CBL-Y371H, a linker region mutant, and CBL-C384R, a RING finger mutant, lead to enhanced GM-CSF signaling. Expression of CBL mutants in the TF-1 cell line resulted in enhanced survival in the absence of GM-CSF. Cells expressing CBL mutations displayed increased phosphorylation of GM-CSF receptor Î²c subunit in response to stimulation, although expression of total GM-CSFR Î²c was lower. This suggested enhanced kinase activity downstream of GM-CSFR. JAK2 and LYN kinase expression is elevated in CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutant cells, resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of CBL and S6 in response to GM-CSF stimulation. Incubation with the JAK2 inhibitor, TG101348, abolished the increased phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c in cells expressing CBL mutants, whereas treatment with the SRC kinase inhibitor dasatinib resulted in equalization of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation signal between wild type CBL and CBL mutant samples. Dasatinib treatment inhibited the elevated phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants. Our study indicates that CBL linker and RING finger mutants lead to enhanced GM-CSF signaling due to elevated kinase expression, which can be blocked using small molecule inhibitors targeting specific downstream pathways.  Keywords: Cytokine, E3 Ubiquitin Ligase, JAK Kinase, Signal Transduction, SRC, CBL, GM-CSF, Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia Go to: Introduction Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a cytokine that regulates the differentiation, survival, proliferation, and functional activation of granulocytes and monocytes in the myeloid lineage (1). In order to mediate its functional activity, GM-CSF binds to its receptor, the GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSFR),2 consisting of GM-CSR Î± and GM-CSFR Î² common (Î²c) subunits. The Î²c subunit of the receptor is shared by the IL-3 and IL-5 receptors. Î²c is the major signaling subunit and is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to cytokine stimulation. Î²c phosphorylation results in the recruitment of various effectors leading to activation of downstream signaling (2â€“4). GM-CSFR Î± is the major binding subunit, which dictates the binding specificity of the receptor complex for GM-CSF (2, 4, 5). The engagement of GM-CSFR by GM-CSF results in the formation of a dodecameric complex of GM-CSFÂ·GM-CSFR Î±Â·GM-CSFR Î²c, which leads to the trans-phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c-associated JAK2 kinases (6). The activated JAK2 kinases phosphorylate GM-CSFR Î²c tyrosine residues, allowing for the recruitment of various effectors and the activation of downstream signaling. GM-CSF stimulation results in the activation of the JAK-STAT, PI3K, and the RAS/MAPK pathways, contributing to GM-CSF-mediated differentiation, proliferation, and survival (reviewed in Refs. 1 and 4).  GM-CSF hypersensitivity is one of the defining characteristics of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). This disease is classified by the World Health Organization as a mixed myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease (7). JMML patients must show persistent monocytosis in the absence of the BCR-ABL oncogene (8). Genetic lesions deregulating the RAS signaling pathway have been identified to lead to JMML pathogenesis. 10â€“15% of JMML patients harbor mutations in neurofibromin protein (NF1) (9, 10), a GTPase-activating protein, which negatively regulates RAS by enhancing the hydrolysis of the active GTP-bound conformation of RAS to the inactive GDP-bound form (11). 35% of JMML patients have mutations in SHP2 (12â€“14), a protein-tyrosine phosphatase that positively regulates the RAS signaling pathway (15, 16). RAS-activating mutations account for another 20â€“25% of JMML-associated mutations (17â€“19). Several groups determined that a proportion of JMML patients have 11q uniparental disomy. CBL mutations were identified upon further analysis of the 11q uniparental disomy samples (20â€“22). The presence of NF1, SHP2, RAS, and CBL mutations are mutually exclusive, raising the question of how CBL mutations can lead to disease development.  CBL mutations have been identified in numerous other myeloid malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic, myeloproliferative, and mixed myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease (23â€“28). The majority of these mutations localize to the CBL linker region or the RING finger. CBL is a ubiquitin E3 ligase, which specifies target proteins for ubiquitination. The linker region and RING finger of CBL play very important roles in its E3 ligase functionality. The linker region contains two conserved tyrosine residues, Tyr-368 and Tyr-371, whose phosphorylation activates and positively regulates E3 ligase activity of CBL (29â€“31). The CBL RING finger is responsible for recruiting active E2s carrying an ubiquitin moiety, allowing for the transfer of ubiquitin to the target substrate (29, 32). Therefore, it is not surprising that mutations in the linker region and RING finger of CBL identified in myeloid malignancies result in a loss of E3 ligase activity.  JMML is associated with GM-CSF hypersensitivity; however, there is a lack of evidence that specifically examines the role of CBL downstream of the GM-CSF receptor and how JMML-associated CBL mutations may affect GM-CSF signaling. CBL is known to become phosphorylated downstream of the Î²c in response to stimulation by IL-3 (33, 34) and GM-CSF (35, 36). Furthermore, CBL associates with the Î²c subunit upon IL-5 stimulation (37). However, these studies do not directly address the role of CBL in GM-CSF signaling.  The objective of this study is to investigate how JMML-associated CBL mutations modulate GM-CSF signaling and lead to GM-CSF hypersensitivity. We expressed wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R in the human TF-1 hematopoietic cell line, which expresses the endogenous GM-CSF receptor at physiological levels (38). Upon GM-CSF stimulation, elevated phosphorylation of GM-CSF Î²c was observed, resulting from elevated JAK2 and LYN phosphorylation. Expression of CBL JMML mutants resulted in enhanced S6 phosphorylation and increased cell survival. Treatment with pharmacologic inhibitors delineated which proximal GM-CSF-dependent pathways are dependent on JAK2 and LYN activation. In summary, our data show that CBL JMML mutants result in enhanced GM-CSF signaling via modulation of JAK2 and LYN tyrosine kinases.  Go to: EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Constructs pMSCV-HA-CBL retroviral vectors were used to create JMML-associated CBL mutants. HA-tagged CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R were constructed using QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kits (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol.  Retrovirus Production HEK 293T cells were plated onto 10-cm dishes (Sarstedt) and grown to around 75% confluence. The 293T cells were transiently transfected with pSV (Gag and Pol proteins) and pVSV-G (envelope protein) and pMSCV-GFP retroviral vectors expressing HA-wild type CBL, HA-CBL-Y371H, or HA-CBL-C384R using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as directed in the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 4.5 Î¼g of pSV, 1.5 Î¼g of VSV-G, and 4.5 Î¼g of pMSCV-IRES-GFP-HA-CBL constructs were mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 in serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM H-21 for 20 min at room temperature. 293T cells were washed with serum-free DMEM H-21, and 4 ml of serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM H-21 was added to the cells. DNA-Lipofectamine 2000 mixture was added to the plated cells and incubated for 6 h at 37 Â°C. Transfection medium was removed from the cells, and 10 ml of RPMI 1640 medium with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum was added. Transfected 293T supernatant containing VSV-G pseudotyped virus carrying pMSCV-HA-CBL was collected at 48 and 72 h post-transfection.  Cell Lines and Culture TF-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 Î¼g of streptomycin/ml, and 2 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF. In order to stably express wild type and mutant CBL, TF-1 cells were infected with VSV-G pseudotyped retrovirus carrying wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R constructs. TF-1 cells were suspended in retroviral supernatant supplemented with 8 ng/ml Polybrene and centrifuged in 50-ml tubes at 12,000 rpm for 75 min. TF-1 cells were resuspended in fresh retroviral Polybrene solution and incubated overnight in 6-well dishes at 37 Â°C. A final round of spinoculation with fresh retroviral supernatant was performed on day 2. TF-1 cells were allowed to expand for 48 h. GFP-positive infected TF-1 cells expressing HA-CBL constructs were purified using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).  XTT Assay TF-1 cells were cytokine-depleted overnight, as described below. 2000 cells were transferred to each well of a 96-well plate in a final volume of 100 Î¼l of RPMI, 10% FCS with the indicated concentrations of GM-CSF. Plates were incubated at 37 Â°C for 48 h prior to the addition of 3 Î¼m phenazine methosulfate (Sigma) and 2 mg/ml XTT (Diagnostic Chemicals). The cells were incubated with the XTT/phenazine methosulfate solution for 6 h at 37 Â°C. The absorption of the reduction product at 450 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer plate reader.  Annexin V Flow Cytometric Analysis TF-1 cells were cytokine-depleted and maintained in cytokine-free media for 72 h. Cells were stained with annexin V-phycoerythrin (PE) according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Pharmingen). Stained cells were analyzed using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer.  Cytokine Deprivation, Stimulation, and Lysis TF-1 cells were washed three times in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), Hanks' balanced salts; depleted in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum overnight at 37 Â°C; and then stimulated with 0.5 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF. Proteasomal and lysosomal degradation was inhibited by incubation of cells with 30 Î¼m MG132 (Calbiochem/Millipore) and 100 Î¼m chloroquine (Sigma), respectively, for 2 h prior to stimulation. JAK2 and LYN kinase activity was inhibited by treatment with 2 m TG101348 (generously provided by Dr. R. Levine) for 4 h or with 0.1 m dasatinib (gift from Dr. D. Hedley) for 2 h, respectively. TF-1 cells were stimulated with 0.5 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF for the indicated times at 37 Â°C.  The cells were washed once in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), Hanks' balanced salts containing 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and supplemented with â€œcOmpleteâ€� protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). After 5 min on ice, the lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 Ã— g for 5 min at 4 Â°C.  Antibodies The 4G10 phosphotyrosine-specific monoclonal antibody and anti-ERK1/2 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology/Millipore. Anti-IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSFR Î²c N-20 (used for immunoblotting) and K-17 (used for immunoprecipitations)), anti-Shp2, and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies specific for phospho-JAK2 (Tyr-1007/1008), JAK2, phospho-SRC family (Tyr-416), phospho-Ser-235/236 S6, and Lynp56 were acquired from Cell Signaling Technologies. An anti-phospho STAT5a/b antibodies were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc./Invitrogen. Anti-STAT5 antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. The monoclonal 12CA5 anti-HA antibody was acquired from Roche Applied Science.  Immunoprecipitations Antibodies along with a 50-Î¼l volume of protein A or protein G-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to 2 mg of lysates for an overnight incubation at 4 Â°C. The beads were washed three times in ice-cold lysis buffer. The immune complexes were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm DTT. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane for Western blotting.  Western Blotting Following the electrophoretic transfer of proteins to PVDF membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), the membranes were blocked at room temperature with 2.5% BSA (w/v) or 5% nonfat dry milk (w/v) in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl) with Tween 20 for 1 h. Membranes were then incubated with an optimal concentration of the primary antibody in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 Â°C. Membranes were washed four times in TBST and incubated with the relevant HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 30â€“60 min. Membranes were washed four times in TBST and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence with autoradiographic film (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). For reprobing, membranes were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 0.1 m Î²-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 Â°C; rinsed twice in TBST; and blocked in 2.5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline prior to primary antibody incubation. Western blots were scanned and quantified using ImageJ software. Quantified Western blots are presented as mean Â± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test.  Go to: RESULTS Enhanced and Prolonged Phosphorylation of the GM-CSFR Î²c in CBL Mutant-expressing Cells GM-CSF hypersensitivity is one of the hallmark features of JMML (39). We utilized the TF-1 hematopoietic cell line to investigate the role of JMML-associated CBL mutations in vitro. TF-1 cells endogenously express the GM-CSF receptor Î± (GM-CSFRÎ±) and the IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSF receptor Î² common chain (GM-CSFR Î²c), and are responsive to GM-CSF. HA-tagged wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R mutants were stably expressed in TF-1 cells (Fig. 1A). All exogenous constructs showed high expression of CBL when compared with vector-infected cells (Fig. 1A). This is especially advantageous because studies have shown that expression of wild type CBL can rescue or mask the effects of CBL mutants (23, 40).  FIGURE 1. FIGURE 1. Enhanced phosphorylation of GM-CSF receptor Î²c upon expression of CBL mutants. A, lysates from parental TF-1 cells as well as from TF-1 cells expressing wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R were probed for CBL expression. IB, immunoblot. B ... Binding of GM-CSF to the GM-CSF receptor complex activates JAK2, leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c. In order to investigate the effects of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants on GM-CSF signaling, we examined the phosphorylation of the GM-CSFR Î²c after stimulation. TF-1 cells expressing wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R were cytokine-depleted and stimulated with GM-CSF. GM-CSFR Î²c was immunoprecipitated from lysates and immunoblotted with the 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Upon GM-CSF stimulation, cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 8 and 9) show enhanced phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c compared with the wild type CBL controls (lanes 2 and 3). Furthermore, prolonged phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c was observed in CBL mutant samples.  CBL plays an important role in stimulation-induced endocytosis, trafficking, and degradation of numerous tyrosine kinase (29, 32) and cytokine receptors (41, 42). To determine whether expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants has an effect on the expression of the GM-CSFR Î²c, as well as its GM-CSF induced degradation, lysates collected from GM-CSF-stimulated TF-1 cells were probed for GM-CSFR Î²c. Because it is likely that CBL-Y371H (23, 30) and CBL-C384R (43) mutations result in a loss of CBL E3 ligase activity, GM-CSFR Î²c levels were expected to be higher in mutant CBL-expressing cells. Surprisingly, expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R (Fig. 2A, lanes 4â€“9) results in a decrease in GM-CSFR Î²c compared with wild type CBL (lanes 1â€“3)-expressing cells at 0, 10, and 60 min (Fig. 2B). However, it is important to note that GM-CSFR Î²c expression decreased after GM-CSF stimulation in wild type and mutant CBL-expressing cells at comparable rates. These results indicate that although expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R results in an overall decreased expression of GM-CSFR Î²c, the degradation of the receptor poststimulation appears not to be disrupted.  FIGURE 2. FIGURE 2. TF-1 cells expressing CBL mutants have lower expression levels of GM-CSFR Î²c. Lysates were collected as described in the legend to Fig. 1. A, immunoblotting (IB) was performed with GM-CSFR Î²c-specific antibody. Blots were reprobed for ... Elevated Levels of JAK2 Kinase in CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing TF-1 Cells Upon binding of GM-CSF to GM-CSFRÎ±, a GM-CSFR Î²c homodimer is recruited (6), bringing the Î²c-associated JAK2 kinase (44, 45) into close proximity, allowing transphosphorylation and subsequent activation of the kinase. Activation of JAK2 is essential for downstream GM-CSF signaling (46, 47). The enhanced and prolonged phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c, along with a decrease in the overall expression of the receptor in CBL mutant-expressing cells may be indicative of elevated kinase activity downstream of GM-CSFR Î²c. Because JAK2 is the main tyrosine kinase downstream of GM-CSFR, the GM-CSF-induced activation of JAK2 was assessed. TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R displayed elevated levels of phosphorylated JAK2 upon GM-CSF stimulation (Fig. 3A, top, lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 8 and 9), compared with the wild type CBL controls (lanes 2 and 3). Reprobing for total JAK2, revealed that the observed enhancement of the phospho-JAK2 signal may be due to an increase in the expression of JAK2 in CBL mutant-expressing cells (Fig. 3, A (middle, lanes 4â€“9) and B).  FIGURE 3. FIGURE 3. Expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants results in elevated JAK2. A, lysates collected from TF-1 cells expressing wild type and CBL mutants were probed for phospho-Tyr-1007/1008 JAK2 and reprobed for total JAK2 and tubulin. B, blots were quantified ... Linker and RING finger mutations disrupt the E3 ligase activity of CBL (29, 31, 32). Such loss of E3 ligase activity has been shown to result in a significant decrease in the EPO-induced ubiquitination of JAK2 (23). In order to determine whether the increase in total JAK2 in CBL mutant expressing cell lines was due to compromised ubiquitination and degradation of the kinase, TF-1 cells expressing wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R were treated with proteasomal (MG-132) and lysosomal (chloroquine) inhibitors prior to stimulation. Inhibition of proteasomal and lysosomal degradation stabilized JAK2 to comparable levels in all three cell lines (Fig. 3C, middle). These results indicate that the expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants affects the degradation of JAK2, leading to elevated levels, which in turn contribute to increased JAK2 phosphorylation and potentially signaling in response to GM-CSF stimulation.  Increased Expression of LYN Kinase in CBL Mutant Cells Although JAK2 is the primary kinase activated downstream of GM-CSF receptor, members of the SRC family kinase are stimulated in response to GM-CSF (48â€“50). Specifically, LYN has been shown to directly associate with GM-CSFR Î²c (51) and to play an important role in mediating the anti-apoptotic effects of GM-CSF in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (49, 52). LYN also associates with GM-CSFRÎ± and is involved in the survival signal required for factor-independent growth of cells expressing the FIÎ” GM-CSFR Î²c mutant (48). Considering that TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R show enhanced survival while exhibiting lower expression of GM-CSFR Î²c, we wanted to determine whether LYN phosphorylation and/or expression was altered in CBL mutant-expressing cells. Lysates collected from GM-CSF-stimulated cells were probed with an antibody specific for pY396-LYN, residing in a phosphorylated motif within the LYN activation loop. Increased LYN phosphorylation was observed in cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants (Fig. 4A, top, lanes 4â€“9), compared with those expressing wild type CBL (lanes 1â€“3). Reprobing for total LYN revealed that CBL mutant cells have increased levels of LYN (p56) (Fig. 4, A (middle, lanes 4â€“9) and B). This observed increase in LYN expression leads to elevated LYN phosphorylation, which may contribute to the enhanced survival of CBL mutant TF-1 cells.  FIGURE 4. FIGURE 4. Increased expression of LYN kinase in CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutant TF-1 cells. A, whole cell lysates collected from TF-1 cells expressing CBL-WT and CBL mutants were immunoblotted with antibodies specific for Tyr(P)-396-LYN. Blots were reprobed for ... Similar to JAK2, treatment with MG-132 and chloroquine stabilized total LYN levels to comparable levels in wild type and mutant cells, indicating that the increase in LYN levels is probably due to the loss of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the CBL mutants (Fig. 4C).  Expression of CBL Mutants Results in Constitutive S6 Phosphorylation and Enhanced Factor-free Survival Investigation of signaling effectors further downstream of the GM-CSF receptor revealed enhanced phosphorylation of SHP2 in CBL mutant-expressing cells relative to wild type CBL controls (Fig. 5A). Constitutive phosphorylation of S6 in TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R, compared with wild type CBL-expressing controls (Fig. 5B), was also observed. No significant differences were observed in the phosphorylation of STAT5 or ERK1/2 (Fig. 5C) between wild type CBL- and mutant CBL-expressing TF-1 cells after GM-CSF stimulation.  FIGURE 5. FIGURE 5. Expression of CBL mutants results in constitutive phosphorylation of S6 and enhanced survival of TF-1 cells. A, SHP2 immunoprecipitations (IP) were performed on lysates collected from TF-1 cells expressing CBL-WT, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R, which were ... XTT assays were performed to determine whether the expression of the CBL linker and RING finger mutants results in enhanced survival and growth. TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants displayed enhanced survival in the absence of GM-CSF relative to cells expressing wild type CBL (Fig. 5D). The increase in the survival of the mutant-expressing cells decreases with increasing concentration of GM-CSF. Cell counting assays were also performed to confirm these results (data not shown). To determine whether the increase in survival was due to a decrease in apoptosis, annexin V staining was performed on cytokine-deprived wild type and mutant CBL-expressing cells. There was a decrease in annexin V-positive TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H relative to wild type CBL-expressing controls, whereas the proportion of annexin V-positive CBL-C384R-expressing cells was comparable with wild type CBL controls (Fig. 5E). These results indicate that JMML-associated CBL mutations result in enhanced survival of TF-1 cells at low doses of GM-CSF.  Constitutive and Enhanced Phosphorylation of CBL Mutants Is Dependent on an SRC Family Kinase CBL is phosphorylated downstream of numerous oncogenic protein-tyrosine kinases (BCR/ABL and v-SRC), receptor tyrosine kinases (PDGF-R, FLT-3, and c-KIT), and cytokine receptors (TPO and EPO) (reviewed in Ref. 53). For example, CBL is tyrosine-phosphorylated downstream of the Î²c chain in response to IL-3 (33, 34) and GM-CSF (35, 36).  The carboxyl-terminal region of CBL contains three major tyrosine phosphorylation sites, Tyr-700, Tyr-731, and Tyr-774 (54). Phosphorylation of these tyrosines leads to the recruitment of SRC homology 2 domain-containing effectors. Phosphorylated Tyr-700 of CBL binds the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, VAV (55). Phosphorylated Tyr-731 acts as the binding site for the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (56, 57), and members of the CRK adaptor protein family have been shown to bind both phosphorylated Tyr-700 and Tyr-774 (58â€“60). Downstream pathways mediated by CBL tyrosine phosphorylation sites play an important role in CBL-mediated signaling. Linker region mutations of CBL have been shown to lead to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL in Ba/F3-FLT3 cells (24).  We were interested in determining whether expression of the linker region Y371H and the RING finger C384R mutations would result in altered CBL tyrosine phosphorylation. CBL was immunoprecipitated from wild type and mutant CBL TF-1 lysates, and phosphorylation was assessed by Tyr(P) immunoblotting (Fig. 6). CBL-Y371H (lanes 4â€“6) and CBL-C384R (lanes 7â€“9) were highly phosphorylated compared with CBL wild type controls (lanes 1â€“3). Both CBL mutants showed constitutive phosphorylation in the absence of GM-CSF stimulation (lanes 4 and 7).  FIGURE 6. FIGURE 6. Dasatinib treatment abolishes the enhanced phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R. TF-1 cells expressing WT and mutant CBL were incubated with dasatinib and TG101348 for 2 and 4 h, respectively, prior to GM-CSF stimulation. Cells were lysed, and HA ... Although numerous members of the SRC family kinases, including LYN (61â€“63), are capable of phosphorylating CBL, there is evidence that Janus kinase family members may also target CBL for tyrosine phosphorylation (64). To determine whether inhibition of JAK2 or SRC family kinases could abolish the enhanced and constitutive phosphorylation of CBL, TF-1 cells expressing wild type and mutant CBL were treated with either the JAK2-specific inhibitor TG101348 or the SRC family kinase inhibitor dasatinib prior to stimulation. The constitutive and enhanced phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants (lanes 22â€“27) persisted in TG101348-treated samples (Fig. 6), whereas pretreatment with dasatinib abolished the elevated phosphorylation of CBL mutants (lanes 13â€“18) to levels comparable with wild type CBL controls (lanes 10â€“12). These results indicate that downstream of the GM-CSF receptor, CBL is phosphorylated by a SRC family kinase, potentially LYN, and mutations in the linker region or the RING finger domain of CBL lead to not only enhanced but also constitutive phosphorylation of CBL.  TG101348-mediated Inhibition of Enhanced Phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c in CBL Mutant-expressing Cells We were interested in determining how the inhibition of JAK2 or SRC family kinases downstream of GM-CSFR would modulate the elevated phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c observed in CBL mutant-expressing cells (Figs. 1B and â€‹and7,7, lanes 1â€“9). TF-1 cells were treated with TG101348 and dasatinib, alone or in combination, prior to stimulation and subsequent GM-CSFR Î²c immunoprecipitation. TG101348 treatment resulted in a significant inhibition of GM-CSF-induced phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c in both wild type CBL- and CBL mutant-expressing cells, resulting in an equally down-modulated level of the phosphorylated receptor (Fig. 7, lanes 10â€“18). This was expected, because JAK2 is known to be the kinase responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of the GM-CSFR Î²c in response to stimulation (47, 65, 66).  FIGURE 7. FIGURE 7. Inhibition of JAK2 activity via treatment with TG101348 abolishes the enhanced phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î² in CBL mutant-expressing cells. TF-1 cells expressing WT-CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R were cytokine-depleted and treated with 2 mm TG101348 ... Interestingly, inhibition of SRC family kinases did not result in the inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation, but it did result in an equivalent level of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation in wild type CBL and CBL mutant samples (Fig. 7, lanes 19â€“27). Treatment with both TG101348 and dasatinib inhibited GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation (Fig. 7, lanes 28â€“36) to similar levels observed in samples treated with only TG101348.  Go to: DISCUSSION Hypersensitivity to GM-CSF is one of the defining characteristics of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Until recently, genes mutated in JMML patients (NF1, SHP2, NRAS, and KRAS) were directly involved in the RAS signaling pathway. The Loh and Maciejewski groups (20â€“22) found that 10â€“15% of JMML patients have mutations in CBL and that these mutations are associated with acquired uniparental disomy. The majority of CBL mutations identified clustered in the linker region and RING finger, both of which play an important role in the E3 ligase activity of CBL. The identification of these JMML-associated CBL mutations raised a number of questions about the role of CBL downstream of GM-CSF receptor, whether CBL is involved in RAS signaling downstream of GM-CSFR, and how mutations in CBL can lead to hypersensitivity to GM-CSF. In order to address these questions, we utilized the TF-1 hematopoietic cell line, which is GM-CSF-responsive (38) and has a low endogenous CBL expression. To examine the functional consequences of CBL linker region mutations, we expressed CBL-Y371H linker and CBL-C384R RING finger mutants, because these are two of the most common CBL mutations observed in JMML patients (21, 22).  We found that expression of these CBL mutants in GM-CSF-stimulated TF-1 cells leads to enhanced and prolonged phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c, which occurred concurrently with elevated expression of both JAK2 and LYN. Assessment of downstream signaling revealed enhanced phosphorylation of S6 in CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing cells relative to wild type CBL controls. TF-1 cells expressing CBL mutations showed enhanced survival in the absence of GM-CSF, and specifically in the case of CBL-Y371H-expressing cells, this is probably due to a decrease in induction of apoptosis. We also observed elevated and constitutive phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants, which was inhibited upon treatment with dasatinib, an SRC family kinase inhibitor. Interestingly, treatment with dasatinib also led to equalization of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation between wild type CBL- and CBL mutant-expressing cells. However, inhibition of JAK2 activity by TG101348 resulted in complete inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation in CBL mutant and wild type CBL control cells.  Expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants results in prolonged and elevated receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, which supports the observed enhancement in survival (67). Martinez-Moczygemba and Huston (37, 68), using the IL-5 receptor as a model for Î²c subunit-sharing cytokine receptors (IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSF), demonstrated that increased Î²c subunit ubiquitination is observed after stimulation. This ubiquitination event leads to the proteasomal degradation of the cytoplasmic tail of the Î²c subunit, which attenuates downstream signaling (37, 68). They also found that the ubiquitination of the Î²c subunit may be mediated by CBL, because the E3 ligase was co-immunoprecipitated with the Î²c subunit. The loss of E3 ligase activity of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants may prevent GM-CSFR Î²c ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the cytoplasmic region of the receptor and culminate in the observed enhancement of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation and elevated levels of JAK2. However, this is unlikely, because we have observed total levels of GM-CSFR Î²c to be lower in CBL mutant cells. Alternatively, increased JAK2 and LYN expression could be correlated with a negative feedback loop that down-regulates GM-CSFR Î²c levels in TF-1 cells. The ubiquitination of Î²c in response to IL-5 stimulation is dependent on JAK2 activity (68, 69). In CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing cells, the enhanced JAK2 activity can potentially lead to increased ubiquitination of the Î²c by other ubiquitin ligases, resulting in decreased overall expression of the receptor subunit.  JAK2 is also regulated via CBL-mediated ubiquitination (23, 70). The expression of CBL mutants Y371H and C384R may result in decreased ubiquitination of JAK2, culminating in elevated levels of JAK2 as well as enhanced JAK2-mediated phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c. We found that in CBL mutant cells, there was elevated expression of JAK2 kinase, which was abolished upon treatment with proteasomal and lysosomal inhibitors.  Similar to JAK2, several members of the SRC family kinases (71), including LYN, have been shown to be ubiquitinated (72) by CBL (73, 74). The enhanced expression of LYN in TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R indicates that, downstream of GM-CSFR, CBL is responsible for LYN ubiquitination. LYN mediates the tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL downstream of Î²1 integrin (61), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (62, 75), and the B-cell antigen receptor (63, 76). We have observed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants, which is abolished upon treatment with the SRC family kinase inhibitor dasatinib. This confirms that LYN is a kinase responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL downstream of the GM-CSFR, and the enhanced phosphorylation of CBL mutants may be a functional consequence of the elevated levels of LYN in CBL mutant-expressing cells.  Phosphorylation of CBL Tyr-731 leads to the activation of the PI3K pathway via recruitment of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (54, 56). The Corey group (62, 77) has shown that LYN couples to the PI3K pathway in a CBL-dependent manner, whereby activated LYN binds and phosphorylates CBL, allowing for the recruitment of p85 to the complex. LYN also activates the PI3K pathway downstream of GM-CSFR Î± (48), promoting cell survival. We have shown that expression of CBL JMML mutants defective in E3 ubiquitin ligase activity leads to aberrant regulation of LYN downstream of GM-CSFR, which ultimately leads to constitutive and enhanced phosphorylation of S6, suggesting elevated PI3K pathway activity. Interestingly, basal activation of S6 has been observed in mononuclear cells isolated from JMML patients (78). Furthermore, in the absence of LYN, the antiapoptotic effects of GM-CSF are abolished (49, 52). At low concentrations of GM-CSF, the signaling pathways activated downstream of the receptor lead to cell survival only, whereas stimulation with higher doses results in cell proliferation and cell survival (79). We have shown that expression of CBL mutants results in enhanced survival, especially at low doses, or in the complete absence of GM-CSF in TF-1 cells. These data suggest that CBL linker and RING finger mutants lower the threshold concentration of GM-CSF required to induce cell survival. Together, these results suggest that in CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing cells, the modulation of the PI3-K pathway due to the increase in LYN levels may be contributing to the observed enhancement of survival in the absence of GM-CSF.  The mechanism by which these mutations lead to elevated GM-CSF signaling and enhanced survival depends on the role of CBL as both an E3 ligase and an adaptor protein. CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants compromise the E3 ligase activity of CBL. We have shown that these loss-of-function mutations lead to increased levels of JAK2 and LYN kinases downstream of the GM-CSFR, potentially due to loss of ubiquitination of the kinases or to the inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c ubiquitination and cytoplasmic domain degradation. These events contribute to the elevated levels of GM-CSF signaling observed in CBL mutant-expressing TF-1 cells. Sanada et al. (23) have shown that Cblâˆ’/âˆ’ LSK cells show a mild cytokine hypersensitivity, but transformation of Cblâˆ’/âˆ’ LSK cells with Cbl linker region mutants significantly enhances the cytokine hypersensitivity, indicating a gain-of-function of the mutants that cannot be ascribed to a simple loss of CBL E3 ligase activity. Inhibition of Cbl-b function by mutant Cbl has been proposed as a possible mechanism (80, 81). However, it is possible that functionality of CBL as an adaptor protein may be contributing to the gain of function of the mutants. Our group, as well as others, has shown that expression of CBL linker and RING finger mutants results in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL (24, 81, 82). This increase in CBL phosphorylation culminates in enhanced PI3K and RAS pathway activation. We found that treatment with dasatinib results in loss of CBL phosphorylation. Interestingly, dasatinib treatment equalized GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation in wild type- and CBL mutant-expressing TF-1 cells. Therefore, dasatinib treatment may decouple the gain-of-function capacity of CBL mutants from the loss of E3 ligase activity. Considering that treatment with JAK2 inhibitor, TG101348, results in complete inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation, dasatinib may provide a treatment option for the enhanced signaling driven by CBL gain-of-function mutations.  Prior studies have shown that expression of CBL linker region and RING finger mutants inhibits stimulation-induced ubiquitination of the EGF-R (23, 29), FLT3, c-KIT, and JAK2 (downstream of EPO-R) (23). Niemeyer et al. (40) have shown that expression of CBL linker region mutants in Ba/F3-EPO-R cells results in an enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, AKT, and S6. In Ba/F3 cells expressing the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase, expression of CBL-Y371 mutants leads to elevated FLT3 phosphorylation as well as AKT and STAT5 (24). Although these studies are useful to probe how CBL mutations perturb FLT3 signaling in AML, no studies have examined the role of CBL JMML mutations in GM-CSF-dependent signaling pathways to date. Our analysis reveals that expression of CBL-Y371H or CBL-C384R in TF-1 cells generates GM-CSF hypersensitivity that affects proximal steps in receptor activation, including GM-CSFR Î²c, JAK2, and LYN coupling to PI3K activation. Unlike with the Ba/F3 results, we failed to observe effects on ERK1/2 or STAT5 activation. Whether this is a function of the unique receptor systems or distinct cell lines remains to be determined.  In conclusion, these studies have confirmed that CBL plays a negative regulatory role downstream of GM-CSFR. We have shown that the enhancement of GM-CSF signaling observed upon loss of CBL E3 ligase activity is due to increased stability of JAK2 and LYN. These results provide in vitro support for further investigation into the applicability of JAK2 and SRC family kinase inhibitors for use in treatment of myeloid malignancies associated with CBL linker region and RING finger mutations.</td>\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) regulate a variety of fundamental cellular processes. CDK10 stands out as one of the last orphan CDKs for which no activating cyclin has been identified and no kinase activity revealed. Previous work has shown that CDK10 silencing increases ETS2 (v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 2)-driven activation of the MAPK pathway, which confers tamoxifen resistance to breast cancer cells. The precise mechanisms by which CDK10 modulates ETS2 activity, and more generally the functions of CDK10, remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that CDK10 is a cyclin-dependent kinase by identifying cyclin M as an activating cyclin. Cyclin M, an orphan cyclin, is the product of FAM58A, whose mutations cause STAR syndrome, a human developmental anomaly whose features include toe syndactyly, telecanthus, and anogenital and renal malformations. We show that STAR syndrome-associated cyclin M mutants are unable to interact with CDK10. Cyclin M silencing phenocopies CDK10 silencing in increasing c-Raf and in conferring tamoxifen resistance to breast cancer cells. CDK10/cyclin M phosphorylates ETS2 in vitro, and in cells it positively controls ETS2 degradation by the proteasome. ETS2 protein levels are increased in cells derived from a STAR patient, and this increase is attributable to decreased cyclin M levels. Altogether, our results reveal an additional regulatory mechanism for ETS2, which plays key roles in cancer and development. They also shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying STAR syndrome.Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play a pivotal role in the control of a number of fundamental cellular processes (1). The human genome contains 21 genes encoding proteins that can be considered as members of the CDK family owing to their sequence similarity with bona fide CDKs, those known to be activated by cyclins (2). Although discovered almost 20 y ago (3, 4), CDK10 remains one of the two CDKs without an identified cyclin partner. This knowledge gap has largely impeded the exploration of its biological functions. CDK10 can act as a positive cell cycle regulator in some cells (5, 6) or as a tumor suppressor in others (7, 8). CDK10 interacts with the ETS2 (v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 2) transcription factor and inhibits its transcriptional activity through an unknown mechanism (9). CDK10 knockdown derepresses ETS2, which increases the expression of the c-Raf protein kinase, activates the MAPK pathway, and induces resistance of MCF7 cells to tamoxifen (6).Here, we deorphanize CDK10 by identifying cyclin M, the product of FAM58A, as a binding partner. Mutations in this gene that predict absence or truncation of cyclin M are associated with STAR syndrome, whose features include toe syndactyly, telecanthus, and anogenital and renal malformations in heterozygous females (10). However, both the functions of cyclin M and the pathogenesis of STAR syndrome remain unknown. We show that a recombinant CDK10/cyclin M heterodimer is an active protein kinase that phosphorylates ETS2 in vitro. Cyclin M silencing phenocopies CDK10 silencing in increasing c-Raf and phospho-ERK expression levels and in inducing tamoxifen resistance in estrogen receptor (ER)+ breast cancer cells. We show that CDK10/cyclin M positively controls ETS2 degradation by the proteasome, through the phosphorylation of two neighboring serines. Finally, we detect an increased ETS2 expression level in cells derived from a STAR patient, and we demonstrate that it is attributable to the decreased cyclin M expression level observed in these cells.Previous SectionNext SectionResultsA yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen unveiled an interaction signal between CDK10 and a mouse protein whose C-terminal half presents a strong sequence homology with the human FAM58A gene product [whose proposed name is cyclin M (11)]. We thus performed Y2H mating assays to determine whether human CDK10 interacts with human cyclin M (Fig. 1 Aâ€“C). The longest CDK10 isoform (P1) expressed as a bait protein produced a strong interaction phenotype with full-length cyclin M (expressed as a prey protein) but no detectable phenotype with cyclin D1, p21 (CIP1), and Cdi1 (KAP), which are known binding partners of other CDKs (Fig. 1B). CDK1 and CDK3 also produced Y2H signals with cyclin M, albeit notably weaker than that observed with CDK10 (Fig. 1B). An interaction phenotype was also observed between full-length cyclin M and CDK10 proteins expressed as bait and prey, respectively (Fig. S1A). We then tested different isoforms of CDK10 and cyclin M originating from alternative gene splicing, and two truncated cyclin M proteins corresponding to the hypothetical products of two mutated FAM58A genes found in STAR syndrome patients (10). None of these shorter isoforms produced interaction phenotypes (Fig. 1 A and C and Fig. S1A).Fig. 1.In a new window Download PPTFig. 1.CDK10 and cyclin M form an interaction complex. (A) Schematic representation of the different protein isoforms analyzed by Y2H assays. Amino acid numbers are indicated. Black boxes indicate internal deletions. The red box indicates a differing amino acid sequence compared with CDK10 P1. (B) Y2H assay between a set of CDK proteins expressed as baits (in fusion to the LexA DNA binding domain) and CDK interacting proteins expressed as preys (in fusion to the B42 transcriptional activator). pEG202 and pJG4-5 are the empty bait and prey plasmids expressing LexA and B42, respectively. lacZ was used as a reporter gene, and blue yeast are indicative of a Y2H interaction phenotype. (C) Y2H assay between the different CDK10 and cyclin M isoforms. The amino-terminal region of ETS2, known to interact with CDK10 (9), was also assayed. (D) Western blot analysis of Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) and CycM-V5-6His expression levels in transfected HEK293 cells. (E) Western blot analysis of Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) immunoprecipitates obtained using the anti-Myc antibody. â€œInputsâ€� correspond to 10 Î¼g total lysates obtained from HEK293 cells coexpressing Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) and CycM-V5-6His. (F) Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitates obtained using the anti-CDK10 antibody or a control goat antibody, from human breast cancer MCF7 cells. â€œInputâ€� corresponds to 30 Î¼g MCF7 total cell lysates. The lower band of the doublet observed on the upper panel comigrates with the exogenously expressed untagged CDK10 and thus corresponds to endogenous CDK10. The upper band of the doublet corresponds to a nonspecific signal, as demonstrated by it insensitivity to either overexpression of CDK10 (as seen on the left lane) or silencing of CDK10 (Fig. S2B). Another experiment with a longer gel migration is shown in Fig. S1D.Next we examined the ability of CDK10 and cyclin M to interact when expressed in human cells (Fig. 1 D and E). We tested wild-type CDK10 (wt) and a kinase dead (kd) mutant bearing a D181A amino acid substitution that abolishes ATP binding (12). We expressed cyclin M-V5-6His and/or Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) in a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293). The expression level of cyclin M-V5-6His was significantly increased upon coexpression with Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) and, to a lesser extent, that of Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd) was increased upon coexpression with cyclin M-V5-6His (Fig. 1D). We then immunoprecipitated Myc-CDK10 proteins and detected the presence of cyclin M in the CDK10 (wt) and (kd) immunoprecipitates only when these proteins were coexpressed pair-wise (Fig. 1E). We confirmed these observations by detecting the presence of Myc-CDK10 in cyclin M-V5-6His immunoprecipitates (Fig. S1B). These experiments confirmed the lack of robust interaction between the CDK10.P2 isoform and cyclin M (Fig. S1C). To detect the interaction between endogenous proteins, we performed immunoprecipitations on nontransfected MCF7 cells derived from a human breast cancer. CDK10 and cyclin M antibodies detected their cognate endogenous proteins by Western blotting. We readily detected cyclin M in immunoprecipitates obtained with the CDK10 antibody but not with a control antibody (Fig. 1F). These results confirm the physical interaction between CDK10 and cyclin M in human cells.To unveil a hypothesized CDK10/cyclin M protein kinase activity, we produced GST-CDK10 and StrepII-cyclin M fusion proteins in insect cells, either individually or in combination. We observed that GST-CDK10 and StrepII-cyclin M copurified, thus confirming their interaction in yet another cellular model (Fig. 2A). We then performed in vitro kinase assays with purified proteins, using histone H1 as a generic substrate. Histone H1 phosphorylation was detected only from lysates of cells coexpressing GST-CDK10 and StrepII-cyclin M. No phosphorylation was detected when GST-CDK10 or StrepII-cyclin M were expressed alone, or when StrepII-cyclin M was coexpressed with GST-CDK10(kd) (Fig. 2A). Next we investigated whether ETS2, which is known to interact with CDK10 (9) (Fig. 1C), is a phosphorylation substrate of CDK10/cyclin M. We detected strong phosphorylation of ETS2 by the GST-CDK10/StrepII-cyclin M purified heterodimer, whereas no phosphorylation was detected using GST-CDK10 alone or GST-CDK10(kd)/StrepII-cyclin M heterodimer (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2.In a new window Download PPTFig. 2.CDK10 is a cyclin M-dependent protein kinase.

The kinase activity was determined by autoradiography of histone H1, whose added amounts were visualized by Coomassie staining (Lower Middle and Bottom). (B) Same as in A, using purified recombinant 6His-ETS2 as a substrate.CDK10 silencing has been shown to increase ETS2-driven c-RAF transcription and to activate the MAPK pathway (6). We investigated whether cyclin M is also involved in this regulatory pathway. To aim at a highly specific silencing, we used siRNA pools (mix of four different siRNAs) at low final concentration (10 nM). Both CDK10 and cyclin M siRNA pools silenced the expression of their cognate targets (Fig. 3 A and C and Fig. S2) and, interestingly, the cyclin M siRNA pool also caused a marked decrease in CDK10 protein level (Fig. 3A and Fig. S2B). These results, and those shown in Fig. 1D, suggest that cyclin M binding stabilizes CDK10. Cyclin M silencing induced an increase in c-Raf protein and mRNA levels (Fig. 3 B and C) and in phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 protein levels (Fig. S3B), similarly to CDK10 silencing. As expected from these effects (6), CDK10 and cyclin M silencing both decreased the sensitivity of ER+ MCF7 cells to tamoxifen, to a similar extent. The combined silencing of both genes did not result in a higher resistance to the drug (Fig. S3C). Altogether, these observations demonstrate a functional interaction between cyclin M and CDK10, which negatively controls ETS2.Fig. 3.In a new window Download PPTFig. 3.Cyclin M silencing up-regulates c-Raf expression.

ETS2 is a short-lived protein degraded by the proteasome (13). A straightforward hypothesis is that CDK10/cyclin M positively controls ETS2 degradation. We thus examined the impact of CDK10 or cyclin M silencing on ETS2 expression levels. The silencing of CDK10 and that of cyclin M caused an increase in the expression levels of an exogenously expressed Flag-ETS2 protein (Fig. S4A), as well as of the endogenous ETS2 protein (Fig. 4A). This increase is not attributable to increased ETS2 mRNA levels, which marginally fluctuated in response to CDK10 or cyclin M silencing (Fig. S4B). We then examined the expression levels of the Flag-tagged ETS2 protein when expressed alone or in combination with Myc-CDK10 or -CDK10(kd), with or without cyclin M-V5-6His. Flag-ETS2 was readily detected when expressed alone or, to a lesser extent, when coexpressed with CDK10(kd). However, its expression level was dramatically decreased when coexpressed with CDK10 alone, or with CDK10 and cyclin M (Fig. 4B). These observations suggest that endogenous cyclin M levels are in excess compared with those of CDK10 in MCF7 cells, and they show that the major decrease in ETS2 levels observed upon CDK10 coexpression involves CDK10 kinase activity. Treatment of cells coexpressing Flag-ETS2, CDK10, and cyclin M with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 largely rescued Flag-ETS2 expression levels (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4.In a new window Download PPTFig. 4.CDK10/cyclin M controls ETS2 stability in human cancer derived cells.

(B) Western blot analysis of exogenously expressed Flag-ETS2 protein levels in MCF7 cells cotransfected with empty vectors or coexpressing Myc-CDK10 (wt or kd), or Myc-CDK10/CycM-V5-6His. The latter cells were treated for 16 h with the MG132 proteasome inhibitor. Proper expression of CDK10 and cyclin M tagged proteins was verified by Western blot analysis. (C and D) Western blot analysis of expression levels of exogenously expressed Flag-ETS2 wild-type or mutant proteins in MCF7 cells, in the absence of (C) or in response to (D) Myc-CDK10/CycM-V5-6His expression. Quantifications are shown in Fig. S4 C and D.A mass spectrometry analysis of recombinant ETS2 phosphorylated by CDK10/cyclin M in vitro revealed the existence of multiple phosphorylated residues, among which are two neighboring phospho-serines (at positions 220 and 225) that may form a phosphodegron (14) (Figs. S5â€“S8). To confirm this finding, we compared the phosphorylation level of recombinant ETS2wt with that of ETS2SASA protein, a mutant bearing alanine substitutions of these two serines. As expected from the existence of multiple phosphorylation sites, we detected a small but reproducible, significant decrease of phosphorylation level of ETS2SASA compared with ETS2wt (Fig. S9), thus confirming that Ser220/Ser225 are phosphorylated by CDK10/cyclin M. To establish a direct link between ETS2 phosphorylation by CDK10/cyclin M and degradation, we examined the expression levels of Flag-ETS2SASA. In the absence of CDK10/cyclin M coexpression, it did not differ significantly from that of Flag-ETS2. This is contrary to that of Flag-ETS2DBM, bearing a deletion of the N-terminal destruction (D-) box that was previously shown to be involved in APC-Cdh1â€“mediated degradation of ETS2 (13) (Fig. 4C). However, contrary to Flag-ETS2 wild type, the expression level of Flag-ETS2SASA remained insensitive to CDK10/cyclin M coexpression (Fig. 4D). Altogether, these results suggest that CDK10/cyclin M directly controls ETS2 degradation through the phosphorylation of these two serines.Finally, we studied a lymphoblastoid cell line derived from a patient with STAR syndrome, bearing FAM58A mutation c.555+1G>A, predicted to result in aberrant splicing (10). In accordance with incomplete skewing of X chromosome inactivation previously found in this patient, we detected a decreased expression level of cyclin M protein in the STAR cell line, compared with a control lymphoblastoid cell line. In line with our preceding observations, we detected an increased expression level of ETS2 protein in the STAR cell line compared with the control (Fig. 5A and Fig. S10A). We then examined by quantitative RT-PCR the mRNA expression levels of the corresponding genes. The STAR cell line showed a decreased expression level of cyclin M mRNA but an expression level of ETS2 mRNA similar to that of the control cell line (Fig. 5B). To demonstrate that the increase in ETS2 protein expression is indeed a result of the decreased cyclin M expression observed in the STAR patient-derived cell line, we expressed cyclin M-V5-6His in this cell line. This expression caused a decrease in ETS2 protein levels (Fig. 5C).Fig. 5.In a new window Download PPTFig. 5.Decreased cyclin M expression in STAR patient-derived cells results in increased ETS2 protein level.

Another Western blot revealing endogenously and exogenously expressed cyclin M levels is shown in Fig. S10B. A quantification of ETS2 protein levels is shown in Fig. S10C.Previous SectionNext SectionDiscussionIn this work, we unveil the interaction between CDK10, the last orphan CDK discovered in the pregenomic era (2), and cyclin M, the only cyclin associated with a human genetic disease so far, and whose functions remain unknown (10). The closest paralogs of CDK10 within the CDK family are the CDK11 proteins, which interact with L-type cyclins (15). Interestingly, the closest paralog of these cyclins within the cyclin family is cyclin M (Fig. S11). The fact that none of the shorter CDK10 isoforms interact robustly with cyclin M suggests that alternative splicing of the CDK10 gene (16, 17) plays an important role in regulating CDK10 functions.The functional relevance of the interaction between CDK10 and cyclin M is supported by different observations. Both proteins seem to enhance each otherâ€™s stability, as judged from their increased expression levels when their partner is exogenously coexpressed (Fig. 1D) and from the much reduced endogenous CDK10 expression level observed in response to cyclin M silencing (Fig. 3A and Fig. S2B). CDK10 is subject to ubiquitin-mediated degradation (18). Our observations suggest that cyclin M protects CDK10 from such degradation and that it is the only cyclin partner of CDK10, at least in MCF7 cells. They also suggest that cyclin M stability is enhanced upon binding to CDK10, independently from its kinase activity, as seen for cyclin C and CDK8 (19). We uncover a cyclin M-dependent CDK10 protein kinase activity in vitro, thus demonstrating that this protein, which was named a CDK on the sole basis of its amino acid sequence, is indeed a genuine cyclin-dependent kinase. Our Y2H assays reveal that truncated cyclin M proteins corresponding to the hypothetical products of two STAR syndrome-associated FAM58A mutations do not produce an interaction phenotype with CDK10. Hence, regardless of whether these mutated mRNAs undergo nonsense-mediated decay (as suggested from the decreased cyclin M mRNA levels in STAR cells, shown in Fig. 5B) or give rise to truncated cyclin M proteins, females affected by the STAR syndrome must exhibit compromised CDK10/cyclin M kinase activity at least in some tissues and during specific developmental stages.We show that ETS2, a known interactor of CDK10, is a phosphorylation substrate of CDK10/cyclin M in vitro and that CDK10/cyclin M kinase activity positively controls ETS2 degradation by the proteasome. This control seems to be exerted through a very fine mechanism, as judged from the sensitivity of ETS2 levels to partially decreased CDK10 and cyclin M levels, achieved in MCF7 cells and observed in STAR cells, respectively. These findings offer a straightforward explanation for the already reported up-regulation of ETS2-driven transcription of c-RAF in response to CDK10 silencing (6). We bring evidence that CDK10/cyclin M directly controls ETS2 degradation through the phosphorylation of two neighboring serines, which may form a noncanonical Î²-TRCP phosphodegron (DSMCPAS) (14). Because none of these two serines precede a proline, they do not conform to usual CDK phosphorylation sites. However, multiple so-called transcriptional CDKs (CDK7, -8, -9, and -11) (to which CDK10 may belong; Fig. S11) have been shown to phosphorylate a variety of motifs in a nonâ€“proline-directed fashion, especially in the context of molecular docking with the substrate (20). Here, it can be hypothesized that the high-affinity interaction between CDK10 and the Pointed domain of ETS2 (6, 9) (Fig. 1C) would allow docking-mediated phosphorylation of atypical sites. The control of ETS2 degradation involves a number of players, including APC-Cdh1 (13) and the cullin-RING ligase CRL4 (21). The formal identification of the ubiquitin ligase involved in the CDK10/cyclin M pathway and the elucidation of its concerted action with the other ubiquitin ligases to regulate ETS2 degradation will require further studies.Our results present a number of significant biological and medical implications. First, they shed light on the regulation of ETS2, which plays an important role in development (22) and is frequently deregulated in many cancers (23). Second, our results contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms causing tamoxifen resistance associated with reduced CDK10 expression levels, and they suggest that, like CDK10 (6), cyclin M could also be a predictive clinical marker of hormone therapy response of ERÎ±-positive breast cancer patients. Third, our findings offer an interesting hypothesis on the molecular mechanisms underlying STAR syndrome. Ets2 transgenic mice showing a less than twofold overexpression of Ets2 present severe cranial abnormalities (24), and those observed in STAR patients could thus be caused at least in part by increased ETS2 protein levels. Another expected consequence of enhanced ETS2 expression levels would be a decreased risk to develop certain types of cancers and an increased risk to develop others. Studies on various mouse models (including models of Down syndrome, in which three copies of ETS2 exist) have revealed that ETS2 dosage can repress or promote tumor growth and, hence, that ETS2 exerts noncell autonomous functions in cancer (25). Intringuingly, one of the very few STAR patients identified so far has been diagnosed with a nephroblastoma (26). Finally, our findings will facilitate the general exploration of the biological functions of CDK10 and, in particular, its role in the control of cell division. Previous studies have suggested either a positive role in cell cycle control (5, 6) or a tumor-suppressive activity in some cancers (7, 8). The severe growth retardation exhibited by STAR patients strongly suggests that CDK10/cyclin M plays an important role in the control of cell proliferation.Previous SectionNext SectionMaterials and MethodsCloning of CDK10 and cyclin M cDNAs, plasmid constructions, tamoxifen response analysis, quantitative RT-PCR, mass spectrometry experiments, and antibody production are detailed in SI Materials and Methods.Yeast Two-Hybrid Interaction Assays. We performed yeast interaction mating assays as previously described (27).Mammalian Cell Cultures and Transfections. We grew human HEK293 and MCF7 cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS (Invitrogen), and we grew lymphoblastoid cells in RPMI 1640 GlutaMAX supplemented with 15% (vol/vol) FBS. We transfected HEK293 and MCF7 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for plasmids, Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) for siRNAs, and Jetprime (Polyplus) for plasmids/siRNAs combinations according to the manufacturersâ€™ instructions. We transfected lymphoblastoid cells by electroporation (Neon, Invitrogen). For ETS2 stability studies we treated MCF7 cells 32 h after transfection with 10 Î¼M MG132 (Fisher Scientific) for 16 h.Coimmunoprecipitation and Western Blot Experiments. We collected cells by scraping in PBS (or centrifugation for lymphoblastoid cells) and lysed them by sonication in a lysis buffer containing 60 mM Î²-glycerophosphate, 15 mM p-nitrophenylphosphate, 25 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (Mops) (pH 7.2), 15 mM EGTA, 15 mM MgCl2, 1 mM Na vanadate, 1 mM NaF, 1mM phenylphosphate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). We spun the lysates 15 min at 20,000 Ã— g at 4 Â°C, collected the supernatants, and determined the protein content using a Bradford assay. We performed the immunoprecipitation experiments on 500 Î¼g of total proteins, in lysis buffer. We precleared the lysates with 20 Î¼L of protein A or G-agarose beads, incubated 1 h 4 Â°C on a rotating wheel. We added 5 Î¼g of antibody to the supernatants, incubated 1 h 4 Â°C on a rotating wheel, added 20 Î¼L of protein A or G-agarose beads, and incubated 1 h 4 Â°C on a rotating wheel. We collected the beads by centrifugation 30 s at 18,000 Ã— g at 4 Â°C and washed three times in a bead buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mM NaF, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and a protease inhibitor coktail (Roche). We directly added sample buffer to the washed pellets, heat-denatured the proteins, and ran the samples on 10% Bis-Tris SDS/PAGE. We transferred the proteins onto Hybond nitrocellulose membranes and processed the blots according to standard procedures. For Western blot experiments, we used the following primary antibodies: anti-Myc (Abcam ab9106, 1:2,000), anti-V5 (Invitrogen R960, 1:5,000), anti-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology B-7, 1:500), anti-CDK10 (Covalab pab0847p, 1:500 or Santa Cruz Biotechnology C-19, 1:500), anti-CycM (home-made, dilution 1:500 or Covalab pab0882-P, dilution 1:500), anti-Raf1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology C-20, 1:1,000), anti-ETS2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology C-20, 1:1,000), anti-Flag (Sigma F7425, 1:1,000), and anti-actin (Sigma A5060, 1:5,000). We used HRP-coupled anti-goat (Santa Cruz Biotechnology SC-2033, dilution 1:2,000), anti-mouse (Bio-Rad 170â€“6516, dilution 1:3,000) or anti-rabbit (Bio-Rad 172â€“1019, 1:5,000) as secondary antibodies. We revealed the blots by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Femto, Thermo Scientific).Production and Purification of Recombinant Proteins.GST-CDK10(kd)/StrepII-CycM. We generated recombinant bacmids in DH10Bac Escherichia coli and baculoviruses in Sf9 cells using the Bac-to-Bac system, as described by the provider (Invitrogen). We infected Sf9 cells with GST-CDK10- (or GST-CDK10kd)-producing viruses, or coinfected the cells with StrepII-CycMâ€“producing viruses, and we collected the cells 72 h after infection. To purify GST-fusion proteins, we spun 250 mL cells and resuspended the pellet in 40 mL lysis buffer (PBS, 250 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM Î²-glycerophosphate, and 0.3 mM Na-vanadate) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). We lysed the cells by sonication, spun the lysate 30 min at 15,000 Ã— g, collected the soluble fraction, and added it to a 1-mL glutathione-Sepharose matrix. We incubated 1 h at 4 Â°C, washed four times with lysis buffer, one time with kinase buffer A (see below), and finally resuspended the beads in 100 Î¼L kinase buffer A containing 10% (vol/vol) glycerol for storage.6His-ETS2. We transformed Origami2 DE3 (Novagen) with the 6His-ETS2 expression vector. We induced expression with 0.2 mM isopropyl-Î²-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 22 Â°C. To purify 6His-ETS2, we spun 50 mL cells and resuspended the pellet in 2 mL lysis buffer (PBS, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole, 1 mM DTT, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing a protease inhibitor mixture without EDTA (Roche). We lysed the cells at 1.6 bar using a cell disruptor and spun the lysate 10 min at 20,000 Ã— g. We collected the soluble fraction and added it to 200 Î¼L Cobalt beads (Thermo Scientific). After 1 h incubation at 4 Â°C on a rotating wheel, we washed four times with lysis buffer. To elute, we incubated beads 30 min with elution buffer (PBS, 250 mM imidazole, pH 7.6) containing the protease inhibitor mixture, spun 30 s at 10,000 Ã— g, and collected the eluted protein.Protein Kinase Assays. We mixed glutathione-Sepharose beads (harboring GST-CDK10 wt or kd, either monomeric or complexed with StrepII-CycM), 22.7 Î¼M BSA, 15 mM DTT, 100 Î¼M ATP, 5 Î¼Ci ATP[Î³-32P], 7.75 Î¼M histone H1, or 1 Î¼M 6His-ETS2 and added kinase buffer A (25 mM TrisÂ·HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, and 3.7 Î¼M heparin, pH 7.5) up to a total volume of 30 Î¼L. We incubated the reactions 30 min at 30 Â°C, added Laemli sample buffer, heat-denatured the samples, and ran 10% Bis-Tris SDS/PAGE. We cut gel slices to detect GST-CDK10 and StrepII-CycM by Western blotting. We stained the gel slices containing the substrate with Coomassie (R-250, Bio-Rad), dried them, and detected the incorporated radioactivity by autoradiography. We identified four unrelated girls with anogenital and renal malformations, dysmorphic facial features, normal intellect and syndactyly of toes. A similar combination of features had been reported previously in a motherâ€“daughter pair1 (Table 1 and Supplementary Note online). These authors noted clinical overlap with Townes-Brocks syndrome but suggested that the phenotype represented a separate autosomal dominant entity (MIM601446). Here we define the cardinal features of this syndrome as a characteristic facial appearance with apparent telecanthus and broad tripartite nasal tip, variable syndactyly of toes 2â€“5, hypoplastic labia, anal atresia and urogenital malformations (Fig. 1aâ€“h). We also observed a variety of other features (Table 1).  Figure 1: Clinical and molecular characterization of STAR syndrome.  Figure 1 : Clinical and molecular characterization of STAR syndrome. (aâ€“f) Facial appearances of cases 1â€“3 (apparent telecanthus, dysplastic ears and thin upper lips; a,c,e), and toe syndactyly 2â€“5, 3â€“5 or 4â€“5 (b,d,f) in these cases illustrate recognizable features of STAR syndrome (specific parental consent has been obtained for publication of these photographs). Anal atresia and hypoplastic labia are not shown. (g,h) X-ray films of the feet of case 2 showing only four rays on the left and delta-shaped 4th and 5th metatarsals on the right (h; compare to clinical picture in d). (i) Array-CGH data. Log2 ratio represents copy number loss of six probes spanning between 37.9 and 50.7 kb, with one probe positioned within FAM58A. The deletion does not remove parts of other functional genes. (j) Schematic structure of FAM58A and position of the mutations. FAM58A has five coding exons (boxes). The cyclin domain (green) is encoded by exons 2â€“4. The horizontal arrow indicates the deletion extending 5' in case 1, which includes exons 1 and 2, whereas the horizontal line below exon 5 indicates the deletion found in case 3, which removes exon 5 and some 3' sequence. The pink horizontal bars above the boxes indicate the amplicons used for qPCR and sequencing (one alternative exon 5 amplicon is not indicated because of space constraints). The mutation 201dupT (case 4) results in an immediate stop codon, and the 555+1G>A and 555-1G>A splice mutations in cases 2, 5 and 6 are predicted to be deleterious because they alter the conserved splice donor and acceptor site of intron 4, respectively.  Full size image (97 KB)  Table 1: Clinical features in STAR syndrome cases  Table 1 - Clinical features in STAR syndrome cases  Full table  On the basis of the phenotypic overlap with Townes-Brocks, Okihiro and Feingold syndromes, we analyzed SALL1 (ref. 2), SALL4 (ref. 3) and MYCN4 but found no mutations in any of these genes (Supplementary Methods online). Next, we carried out genome-wide high-resolution oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)5 analysis (Supplementary Methods) of genomic DNA from the most severely affected individual (case 1, with lower lid coloboma, epilepsy and syringomyelia) and identified a heterozygous deletion of 37.9â€“50.7 kb on Xq28, which removed exons 1 and 2 of FAM58A (Fig. 1i,j). Using real-time PCR, we confirmed the deletion in the child and excluded it in her unaffected parents (Supplementary Fig. 1a online, Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 1 online). Through CGH with a customized oligonucleotide array enriched in probes for Xq28, followed by breakpoint cloning, we defined the exact deletion size as 40,068 bp (g.152,514,164_152,554,231del(chromosome X, NCBI Build 36.2); Fig. 1j and Supplementary Figs. 2,3 online). The deletion removes the coding regions of exons 1 and 2 as well as intron 1 (2,774 bp), 492 bp of intron 2, and 36,608 bp of 5' sequence, including the 5' UTR and the entire KRT18P48 pseudogene (NCBI gene ID 340598). Paternity was proven using routine methods. We did not find deletions overlapping FAM58A in the available copy number variation (CNV) databases.  Subsequently, we carried out qPCR analysis of the three other affected individuals (cases 2, 3 and 4) and the mother-daughter pair from the literature (cases 5 and 6). In case 3, we detected a de novo heterozygous deletion of 1.1â€“10.3 kb overlapping exon 5 (Supplementary Fig. 1b online). Using Xq28-targeted array CGH and breakpoint cloning, we identified a deletion of 4,249 bp (g.152,504,123_152,508,371del(chromosome X, NCBI Build 36.2); Fig. 1j and Supplementary Figs. 2,3), which removed 1,265 bp of intron 4, all of exon 5, including the 3' UTR, and 2,454 bp of 3' sequence.  We found heterozygous FAM58A point mutations in the remaining cases (Fig. 1j, Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 1). In case 2, we identified the mutation 555+1G>A, affecting the splice donor site of intron 4. In case 4, we identified the frameshift mutation 201dupT, which immediately results in a premature stop codon N68XfsX1. In cases 5 and 6, we detected the mutation 556-1G>A, which alters the splice acceptor site of intron 4. We validated the point mutations and deletions by independent rounds of PCR and sequencing or by qPCR. We confirmed paternity and de novo status of the point mutations and deletions in all sporadic cases. None of the mutations were seen in the DNA of 60 unaffected female controls, and no larger deletions involving FAM58A were found in 93 unrelated array-CGH investigations.  By analyzing X-chromosome inactivation (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. 4 online), we found complete skewing of X inactivation in cases 1 and 3â€“6 and almost complete skewing in case 2, suggesting that cells carrying the mutation on the active X chromosome have a growth disadvantage during fetal development. Using RT-PCR on RNA from lymphoblastoid cells of case 2 (Supplementary Fig. 2), we did not find any aberrant splice products as additional evidence that the mutated allele is inactivated. Furthermore, FAM58A is subjected to X inactivation6. In cases 1 and 3, the parental origin of the deletions could not be determined, as a result of lack of informative SNPs. Case 5, the mother of case 6, gave birth to two boys, both clinically unaffected (samples not available). We cannot exclude that the condition is lethal in males. No fetal losses were reported from any of the families.  The function of FAM58A is unknown. The gene consists of five coding exons, and the 642-bp coding region encodes a protein of 214 amino acids. GenBank lists a mRNA length of 1,257 bp for the reference sequence (NM_152274.2). Expression of the gene (by EST data) was found in 27 of 48 adult tissues including kidney, colon, cervix and uterus, but not heart (NCBI expression viewer, UniGene Hs.496943). Expression was also noted in 24 of 26 listed tumor tissues as well as in embryo and fetus. Genes homologous to FAM58A (NCBI HomoloGene: 13362) are found on the X chromosome in the chimpanzee and the dog. The zebrafish has a similar gene on chromosome 23. However, in the mouse and rat, there are no true homologs. These species have similar but intronless genes on chromosomes 11 (mouse) and 10 (rat), most likely arising from a retrotransposon insertion event. On the murine X chromosome, the flanking genes Atp2b3 and Dusp9 are conserved, but only remnants of the FAM58A sequence can be detected.  FAM58A contains a cyclin-box-fold domain, a protein-binding domain found in cyclins with a role in cell cycle and transcription control. No human phenotype resulting from a cyclin gene mutation has yet been reported. Homozygous knockout mice for Ccnd1 (encoding cyclin D1) are viable but small and have reduced lifespan. They also have dystrophic changes of the retina, likely as a result of decreased cell proliferation and degeneration of photoreceptor cells during embryogenesis7, 8.  Cyclin D1 colocalizes with SALL4 in the nucleus, and both proteins cooperatively mediate transcriptional repression9. As the phenotype of our cases overlaps considerably with that of Townes-Brocks syndrome caused by SALL1 mutations1, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation to find out if SALL1 or SALL4 would interact with FAM58A in a manner similar to that observed for SALL4 and cyclin D1. We found that FAM58A interacts with SALL1 but not with SALL4 (Supplementary Fig. 5 online), supporting the hypothesis that FAM58A and SALL1 participate in the same developmental pathway.  How do FAM58A mutations lead to STAR syndrome? Growth retardation (all cases; Table 1) and retinal abnormalities (three cases) are reminiscent of the reduced body size and retinal anomalies in cyclin D1 knockout mice7, 8. Therefore, a proliferation defect might be partly responsible for STAR syndrome. To address this question, we carried out a knockdown of FAM58A mRNA followed by a proliferation assay. Transfection of HEK293 cells with three different FAM58A-specific RNAi oligonucleotides resulted in a significant reduction of both FAM58A mRNA expression and proliferation of transfected cells (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. 6 online), supporting the link between FAM58A and cell proliferation.  We found that loss-of-function mutations of FAM58A result in a rather homogeneous clinical phenotype. The additional anomalies in case 1 are likely to result from an effect of the 40-kb deletion on expression of a neighboring gene, possibly ATP2B3 or DUSP9. However, we cannot exclude that the homogeneous phenotype results from an ascertainment bias and that FAM58A mutations, including missense changes, could result in a broader spectrum of malformations. The genes causing the overlapping phenotypes of STAR syndrome and Townes-Brocks syndrome seem to act in the same pathway. Of note, MYCN, a gene mutated in Feingold syndrome, is a direct regulator of cyclin D2 (refs. 10,11); thus, it is worth exploring whether the phenotypic similarities between Feingold and STAR syndrome might be explained by direct regulation of FAM58A by MYCN.  FAM58A is located approximately 0.56 Mb centromeric to MECP2 on Xq28. Duplications overlapping both MECP2 and FAM58A have been described and are not associated with a clinical phenotype in females12, but no deletions overlapping both MECP2 and FAM58A have been observed to date13. Although other genes between FAM58A and MECP2 have been implicated in brain development, FAM58A and MECP2 are the only genes in this region known to result in X-linked dominant phenotypes; thus, deletion of both genes on the same allele might be lethal in both males and females.  \n",





                                                                                                                                                Abstract Background  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a heterogeneous group of disorders with a number of genetic and proteomic alterations. c-CBL is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and adaptor molecule important in normal homeostasis and cancer. We determined the genetic variations of c-CBL, relationship to receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR and MET), and functionality in NSCLC.  Methods and Findings  Using archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) extracted genomic DNA, we show that c-CBL mutations occur in somatic fashion for lung cancers. c-CBL mutations were not mutually exclusive of MET or EGFR mutations; however they were independent of p53 and KRAS mutations. In normal/tumor pairwise analysis, there was significant loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for the c-CBL locus (22%, nâ€Š=â€Š8/37) and none of these samples revealed any mutation in the remaining copy of c-CBL. The c-CBL LOH also positively correlated with EGFR and MET mutations observed in the same samples. Using select c-CBL somatic mutations such as S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* (obtained from Caucasian, Taiwanese and African-American samples, respectively) transfected in NSCLC cell lines, there was increased cell viability and cell motility.  Conclusions  Taking the overall mutation rate of c-CBL to be a combination as somatic missense mutation and LOH, it is clear that c-CBL is highly mutated in lung cancers and may play an essential role in lung tumorigenesis and metastasis.  Go to: Introduction In the US alone, each year approximately 219,400 people are diagnosed with lung cancers, out of which more than 145,000 of them succumb to the disease [1]. This number is roughly equivalent to the combined mortality rates of cancers of the breast, prostate, colon, liver, kidney and melanoma [1]. In addition the prognosis is usually poor and the five-year survival rate is less than 15%. There are also significant ethnic differences for lung cancer, and the outcome is worse for blacks compared to whites. Gender differences are also striking with women having significantly better prognosis as compared to men. There are a number of genetic alterations that can occur in lung cancer. As an example, in NSCLC, mutations in KRAS, p53, EGFR and MET have been identified. Many of these pathways, especially Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) are controlled by c-CBL.  CBL (Casitas B-lineage lymphoma) is a mammalian gene located on human chromosome 11q23.3 [2] and is involved in cell signaling and protein ubiquitination [3]. CBL proteins belong to the RING finger class of ubiquitin ligases (E3) and there are three homologues c-CBL, CBL-b, CBL-3 [4]. The c-CBL and CBL-b genes are ubiquitously expressed with the highest levels in hematopoietic tissues [5]. c-CBL consists of four regions encoding for functionally distinct protein domains: the N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain, the linker region, the catalytic RING finger domain, the proline-rich region and the c-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain that also overlaps with a leucine-zipper (LZ) domain [3]. Both TKB and RING finger domains are essential for ligand-induced ubiquitination of RTKs [6], [7], [8], [9]. The RING finger domain is required for the recruitment of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. The TKB domain includes four-helix bundle (4H), a calcium-biding EF hand, and a modified SH2 domain, which binds to phosphotyrosine residues [3], [10], [11], [12]. In addition, the proline-rich region of c-CBL can associate with the SH3 domain of Grb2, which can indirectly recruit c-CBL to RTKs via the GRB2 adaptor protein [7], [13], [14].  c-CBL also binds to EGFR and acts as the E3 that targets EGFR for ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, CBL desensitizes EGF signaling and opposes cellular proliferation induced by EGF [15]. EGF activation also appears to activate the tyrosine kinase SRC, which phosphorylates c-CBL and in turn activates the ubiquitination and degradation of EGFR [16], [17], [18]. A recent study shows that defective endocytosis of EGFR is characterized by a deletion mutant and the point mutation L858R, whereby its association with c-CBL and subsequent ubiquitination are impaired [19]. Recently, the first human c-CBL mutations were reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients [20]. The mutation R420Q inhibits FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitination [20].  Not only can E3 activity be important in oncogenesis, c-CBL has a dual but separate function as a signal transduction molecule. We have previously shown that c-CBL is important in binding CRKL and BCR/ABL in hematopoietic cells. Also, it can bind and modulate functions of cytoskeleton by binding to proteins like talin and paxillin. The TKB domain is important in binding to a number of molecules, and they then function in signal transduction.  Given the critical role of CBL in normal homeostasis and cancer, we hypothesized that it might be mutated in lung cancers. In this study, we report novel c-CBL somatic mutations S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* in Caucasian, Taiwanese and African-American lung cancer patients, respectively. Expressing these mutations in NSCLC cell lines lead to increased proliferation and cell motility. We show that c-CBL mutations occur with or without MET or EGFR mutations but are mutually exclusive of a LOH at the c-CBL locus. Additionally, c-CBL LOH is associated with either MET or EGFR mutations. We thus hypothesize that c-CBL mutations might contribute to the oncogenic potential of MET and EGFR in lung cancer.  Go to: Methods Ethics Statement  Written consent on all research on human subjects has been obtained from the Institutional Review Board, University of Chicago and covers all research performed in the laboratory. The following is their contact information: Institutional Review Board, The University of Chicago, McGiffert Hall, 5751 S. Woodlawn Ave., 2nd floor, Chicago, IL 60637. Written informed consents were received from all patients whose tissue samples were used for this study.  Tissue Samples  Lung cancer tissue and paired adjacent normal lung tissues were obtained from 50 Caucasian, 29 African-Americans and 40 Taiwanese NSCLC patients who were recruited at the University of Chicago Hospital (Chicago, USA) (Caucasian and African-American patients) and Taipei Veterans General Hospital of Taiwan (Taiwanese patients) after obtaining appropriate Institutional Review Board permission and informed consent from the patients. Out of 119 samples, 77 were men, 38 were women and 4 were unknown with age at diagnosis ranging from 47 to 90 years. In terms of tumor types, 53 were adenocarcinoma, 32 were squamous cell carcinoma and 34 were large cell carcinoma. 49 were stage I, 14 were stage II, 34 were stage III, and 13 were stage IV (Table S1).  Cell Culture  Human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells A549 and H358 were maintained in DMEM and RPMI-1640, respectively. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in DMEM. Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 Âµg/ml of streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were cultured at 37Â°C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.  c-CBL Gene Mutational Analysis  Exons 2 to 16 of c-CBL gene were individually amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers are listed in Table S2. PCR conditions were 1 cycle of 95Â°C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles of 94Â°C for 30 seconds, 58Â°C for 30 seconds and 72Â°C for 2 minutes; and one cycle of 72Â°C for 10 minutes. PCR products were treated with ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH) and sequenced by Big-Dye Terminator Chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequencing was performed on the forward coding strand with confirmation of c-CBL alterations performed by sequencing the reverse strand as well. Chromatograms were analyzed for mutations using Mutation Surveyor v2.61 (Softgenetics, State College, PA).  Plasmid Constructs and Site-Directed Mutagenesis  The wild-type c-CBL cDNA insert was subcloned into the pAlterMax expression vector using XhoI and SalI restriction enzyme sites (Promega, Madison, WI). Using this parental plasmid pAlterMax-c-CBL, the TKB domain double mutation (S80N/H94Y), the point mutation (Q249E), and the C-terminal point mutation W802* of c-CBL were created using the following primers: 5â€²-GCTGGCGCTAAAGAATAACCCACCTTATATCTTAGAC-3â€² and 5â€²-CTACCAGATACCTACCAGTATCTCCGTACTATCTTGTC-3â€² for the double mutation S80N/H94Y; 5â€²-CTTTACCCGACTCTTTGAGCCCTGGTCCTCTTTGC-3â€² for Q249E, and 5â€²-CAGCTCCTCCTTTGGCTGATTGTCTCTGGATGGTGATC-3â€² for W802* along with their complementary primers using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis XL kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The constructs were confirmed for the point mutations by standard DNA sequencing of both strands.  Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) Analysis  Five microsatellites on chromosome 11 (3 on 11q at or within 200 kb up or downstream of the c-CBL gene and 2 control markers on 11p) were selected for analysis (Table S3). Established microsatellite markers and respective primer sequences were selected from the GeneLoc database (http://genecards.weizmann.ac.il/geneloc/index.shtml, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel). Primers were custom designed and each forward primer was fluorescently labeled at the 5â€² end with FAM, PET, NED, or VIC (Applied Biosystems). Primer annealing temperatures and duplex scores were evaluated with NIST Primer Tools (http://yellow.nist.gov:8444/dnaAnalysis/primerToolsPage.do; National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD). Primers were verified by performing PCR with control DNA (isolated from TK6 cells) and resolving the products on agarose gels. Bands were visualized with an UV transilluminator. Genomic DNA was extracted from tumor samples and paired normal lung tissue. Primers were grouped into multiplex combinations shown in Table S4. Marker D11S929 served as an internal control to check for consistency in PCRs and of peaks from capillary electrophoresis. Multiplex PCRs were carried out in a volume of 10 ÂµL that contained 1 ÂµL genomic DNA (20â€“50 ng), 0.5 ÂµM of each primer (1.0 ÂµM total for each primer pair), 400 ÂµM dNTPs, 1X PCR buffer containing MgCl2, and 0.2 U Taq DNA polymerase. PCR was performed on the ABI GeneAmp 9700 PCR System under the following conditions: 5 min at 94Â°C; 30 cycles of 30 sec at 94Â°C, 1 min at 60Â°C, 1 min at 72Â°C; and 5 min at 72Â°C. The PCR products were separated by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI 3130XL DNA Analyzer. Chromatograms were analyzed with Peak Scanner 1.0 and GeneMapper 3.7 software (Applied Biosystems) for allelic alterations. The area of the peaks produced by the DNA PCR products was quantified for each allele. The ratio of the allelic areas was calculated for each tumor and paired normal DNA sample. When the qLOH (allelic ratio for the tumor peaks divided by the allelic ratio of paired normal sample) was â‰¤0.5 or â‰¥2.0 for c-CBL and at least one other 11q marker in at least two separate experiments, the sample was considered as having an allelic imbalance and interpreted as LOH. Samples were evaluated in at least two separate experiments and samples showing prospective LOH at c-CBL repeated a third time which included a new control marker at the BAX locus (data not shown) on chromosome 19 to verify integrity of sample DNA.  Transfection of c-Cbl Constructs  The A549 cell line was transfected using the Fugene HD (Roche, Nutley, NJ) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eight Âµg of plasmid DNA, containing either no insert (empty vector), wild-type c-CBL, S80N/H94Y c-CBL, Q249E c-CBL or W802* CBL was used for transfection in a 6-well culture plate. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and analyzed for expression.  c-CBL Knockdown  c-CBL knockdown was performed using lentiviral transduction using MISSION lentiviral transduction particles (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as per manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1Ã—105 H358 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates and infected the following day with c-CBL lentiviral shRNA constructs. To generate stable c-CBL knockdown cell lines, cells were selected for 2 days with 1 Âµg/ml puromycin. c-CBL levels were determined using whole cell lysates by immunoblotting with anti-CBL antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA).  Cell Viability Assay  Cells were transfected as described above in the transfection assay. Forty-eight hours after transfection, viability of cells was assessed using Trypan Blue exclusion.  Wound Healing Assay  A549 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured for 48 h until 100% confluent. The medium was then changed and the cells were transfected as described in the transfection assay. Twelve hours after transfection, a straight scratch was made across the cell layer using a 1 ml pipette tip. The cells were then gently washed with 1Ã— PBS to remove cellular debris and the media was replaced. Photographs were taken of the wound region every 12 h until 48 h.  Western Blot Analysis  Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were collected and washed twice in 1X PBS, then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5M Tris-HCl with pH 7.4, 1.5 M NaCl, 2.5% deoxycholic acid, 10 mM EDTA, 10% NP-40, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 Âµg/mL leupeptin, and 10 Âµg/mL aprotinin) for 5 minutes. The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4Â°C, and protein content of the supernatant was measured. Total cell lysates (50 Âµg/well) were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and the gels transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman, Piscataway, NJ). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing Tween-20 (PBST) (1X PBS, 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody at 4Â°C overnight. Membranes then were washed three times with PBST and probed with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were again washed three times in PBST and bands were visualized using Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (BioRad, Valencia, CA) on a Chemidoc Gel documentation system (BioRad, Valencia, CA). Antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies and used at the following dilutions (c-CBL, 1âˆ¶5000; c-MET, 1âˆ¶5000; EGFR, 1âˆ¶5000; ubiquitin, 1âˆ¶1000; HA, 1âˆ¶5000 and Î²-actin, 1âˆ¶10,000).  Flow Cytometry  Cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow cytometry. Approximately 2Ã—106 cells were grown in media containing 10% FBS. Cells were harvested by trypsin/EDTA treatment, washed with 1X PBS three times and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 2 h. Cells were washed again with cold PBS and stained with a solution containing 25 Âµg/mL propidium iodide, 200 Âµg/mL RNase A, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes in the dark. Cell cycle analysis was performed using a Guava PCA-96 flow cytometer (Guava Technologies, Millipore, Billerica, MA).  Ubiquitin Ligase Activity  293T cells were maintained in culture in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin (100 units/mL) and streptomycin (100 Âµg/mL) were transfected with 0.2 Âµg EGFR-pcDNA3 and 2 Âµg HA-tagged c-CBL constructs as indicated using calcium phosphate according to manufacturer's protocol (Profection, Promega, Madison, WI). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were starved overnight in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS, and then treated with or without EGF (100 ng/ml) for 15 min. The cells were collected and washed two times in ice-cold PBS containing 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X100, 10% Glycerol, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors). Lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 10 min at 4Â°C. EGFR immunoprecipitations were performed on 200 Âµg of cleared lysate using 250 ng of rabbit-anti-EGFR and Protein A/G Plus Sepharose overnight at 4Â°C. Precipitations were washed 5 times in lysis buffer before boiling in Laemmli buffer. Elutions were immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin and EGFR. Twenty micrograms of cleared lysate were immunoblotted for each of the c-CBL constructs using anti-HA.  Statistical Analysis  Mutation rates between different groups were compared using Fisher's exact test. For continuous variables, group comparisons were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Sidak's adjustment for multiple comparisons. Experiments involving repeated measurements over time were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with the Greenhouse-Geisser adjustment to the degrees of freedom. Analyses were conducted using STATA (v10.1) software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).  Go to: Results c-CBL Gene Mutations in Lung Cancer  To investigate the role of c-CBL in lung cancer, we analyzed its genomic DNA in tumor and paired normal samples drawn from multiple ethnicities. The lung tumor samples represented Caucasians (nâ€Š=â€Š50), African-Americans (nâ€Š=â€Š29), and Taiwanese (nâ€Š=â€Š40) lung cancer patients. We designed 12 pairs of primers to sequence the coding region of c-CBL gene that spans exons 2 to 16 (Table S2). We identified 8 unique somatic mutations in c-CBL exons among 8 different patients. A variation L620F, a known SNP (rs2227988) in exon 11 was also detected. Importantly, the eight novel non-synonymous mutations were confirmed by sequencing both strands of c-CBL genomic DNA obtained from lung tumor samples (Table 1). Moreover, none of the 8 mutations were detected in the corresponding normal tissue, indicating that these were somatic mutations. Four synonymous single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were also identified but were not used further in this study.  Table 1 Table 1 c-CBL mutation analysis in 119 lung cancer patient tumor tissues. Three of the 8 novel non-synonymous mutations were located in the TKB (tyrosine kinase binding) domain (S80N, H94Y, and Q249E), one in the RING finger domain (V391I), one in the proline-rich region (72515_72517 del ATG), and three in the C-terminal region (W802*, R830K, and A848T) of the c-CBL protein (Figure 1A and Figure S1). In Figure 1B, we show model chromatograms of representative samples.  Figure 1 Figure 1 c-CBL mutations and LOH in non-small cell lung cancer. 11q LOH of c-CBL Gene  Paired lung tumor and normal lung tissue samples from Taiwanese patients (nâ€Š=â€Š37) were investigated for LOH. Eight (21.6%) showed LOH at the c-CBL locus on chromosome 11 while 29 samples (78.4%) revealed normal allelic contribution at the microsatellite markers (Figures 1C and D).  c-CBL Mutations in Different Ethnic Groups  The c-CBL double mutant S80N/H94Y was found in the same patient and the overall mutation rate for c-CBL in lung tumors was 6.7% (8/119). The frequency of c-CBL mutation was highest in large cell carcinoma (14.7%; 5 of 34 patients) followed by squamous carcinoma (6.3%; 2 of 32 patients) and the least was observed in adenocarcinoma (AD) (1.8%; 1 of 53 patients), although these rates were not statistically significant (pâ€Š=â€Š0.292). Mutation rates were 6.0% among Caucasians (0 of 20 in AD; 0 of 10 in SQ; and 3 of 20 in LC), 13.8% in African-Americans (1 of 10 in AD; 1 of 10 in SQ; and 2 of 9 in LC), and 2.5% (0 of 23 in AD; 1 of 12 in SQ; and 0 of 5 in LC) in the Taiwanese population. Additionally two Taiwanese patients with lung cancer (one squamous and one adenocarcinoma) had the known SNP L620F. Ethnic differences were not statistically significant, however the power to detect differences was low.  Mutations in MET and EGFR Can Be Co-Associated with c-CBL Alterations  Since East Asians with lung cancer have a higher frequency of EGFR and MET mutations in lung tumors [21], [22], we also determined mutations in EGFR and MET in the same Taiwanese cohort samples and compared the results with the observed c-CBL alterations (LOH and/or mutations). In the 37 samples tested, we did not find any overlap between c-CBL mutations and c-CBL LOH (Figure 2). Of the three c-CBL mutants (including the known L620F SNP, rs2227988), one of the samples had a MET mutation (N375S) and the other had an EGFR mutation (L858R). Among the 8 samples that had a LOH at the c-CBL locus 5 had an additional mutation in MET (N375S) and 2 had an EGFR exon 19 deletion. Twenty-six samples had neither c-CBL mutation nor c-CBL LOH (3 patients had a c-CBL mutation but no c-CBL LOH). Among these 26 samples 9 had a MET mutation (8 N375S, 1 L211W), 13 had an EGFR mutation (7 exon 9 deletion, 6 L858R) and 4 had no other MET or EGFR mutation. Thus the rate of MET or EGFR mutations among patients with LOH at the c-CBL locus (7 of 8) was similar to that seen in patients without c-CBL mutation or LOH (22 of 26 patients) (pâ€Š=â€Š0.99). These 4 patients with no identifiable mutation in c-CBL, MET or EGFR represented 10.8% of the 37 patients analyzed in the Taiwanese patient cohort. Conversely, 89.2% Taiwanese lung cancer patients have an identifiable mutation in either c-CBL, MET or EGFR or a combination of the three genes (Figure 2). Additionally, we determined p53 and KRAS mutations in these Taiwanese cohorts. Two p53 and 1 KRAS mutation were detected. The single KRAS mutation overlapped with one p53 mutation. This patient also had the EGFR exon 19 deletion but had no c-CBL mutation. The other p53 mutation sample had a c-CBL LOH with concurrent MET N375S mutation. Thus, in the Taiwanese samples analyzed, p53/KRAS mutations and c-CBL mutations were mutually exclusive (data not shown).  Figure 2 Figure 2 c-CBL mutations and relationship to MET and EGFR mutations in lung cancer. Cellular Functions of c-CBL Alterations in the Context of Lung Tumorigenesis  A. E3 activity is intact in the mutant c-CBL proteins To investigate whether the different c-CBL mutations affect the E3 activity, EGFR was chosen as a model substrate for c-CBL E3 function. All of the c-CBL mutants tested enhanced ubiquitination of the activated EGFR similar to the wild-type c-CBL protein. This result demonstrates that the catalytic activity of the c-CBL mutants is not impaired when EGFR was the substrate. (Figure 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Ubiquitination, viability, expression and cell cycle analysis of various c-CBL mutants. B. Effect on lung cancer cell viability The effect of a representative c-CBL mutant from each of the three ethnic backgrounds on lung cancer cell viability in cell lines was determined. S80N/H94Y double mutation, Q249E, and W802* were identified in lung tumor samples obtained from a Caucasian, a Taiwanese and an African-American, respectively. As described in methods, the c-CBL wild-type (WT) and the above three mutants were expressed after cloning them into pAlterMax vector in A549 cells. These cells express relatively low basal levels of endogenous c-CBL (data not shown). Transfection efficiency was comparable between different groups and the number of cells transfected with c-CBL wild-type construct was about 70% compared to control cells that were transfected with the empty vector. Cells transfected with S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* c-CBL mutant constructs resulted in increased number of viable cells that was 132.3%, 120.8% and 147.9% higher respectively, relative to the empty vector control transfected cells and significantly different from the wild-type construct (pâ€Š=â€Š0.022, pâ€Š=â€Š0.049, and pâ€Š=â€Š0.008, respectively) (Figure 3B). Relative levels of c-CBL protein in whole cell lysates prepared from samples obtained from a parallel experiment was determined. The c-CBL protein levels in samples representing untransfected and empty vector transfected cells were comparable and those representing the c-CBL WT and the three c-CBL mutants were comparable (Figure 3C).  C. Effect on cell cycle To investigate if the increases in cell viability in different c-CBL mutants are due to increased cellular proliferation, a cell cycle analysis was performed. A549 cells were transfected with the c-CBL WT or the three different mutants: S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802*. The empty vector transfectant was used as a control. Forty-eight hours after transfection cell cycle analysis was performed as described in materials and methods. There was no significant change in the subG1, G1 or the S phase of the cell cycle among the different mutants compared to the WT construct (pâ€Š=â€Š0.64, pâ€Š=â€Š0.40, and pâ€Š=â€Š0.28, respectively). The G2/M phase of the cell cycle showed an increase in cell numbers for the three mutants, S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802*, when compared to the WT but again the difference was not statistically significant (pâ€Š=â€Š0.25) (Figure 3D).  D. Effect on cell motility To investigate the effect of the expression of the above three c-CBL mutants on cell migration, we carried out wound healing assay as described in materials and methods. The closing of the scratch or the wound was monitored at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. (Figure 4A). In all the samples, that represented cells transfected with mutants, the wound gap was much smaller than that seen in the sample that represented cells transfected with c-CBL WT (p<0.001). We also determined the rate of wound closure for all the five groups. At 48 h, wild-type c-CBL transfectants showed 61.1% open wound while the S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* mutants showed 18.7%, 23.9% and 34.3% open wound respectively (p<0.001) (Figure 4B).  Figure 4 Figure 4 c-CBL mutations affect wound healing in A549 cells. E. c-CBL knockdown increases cell viability It is hypothesized that the LOH seen in our samples could lead to decreased expression of c-CBL. Thus we tested the effect of c-CBL knockdown in lung cancer cells. Compared to A549, H358 lung cancer cells express relatively high levels of endogenous c-CBL (data not shown). c-CBL expression was knocked down using lentiviral construct that expressed c-CBL specific shRNA and compared the results with those that were transduced with scrambled shRNA and the results are shown in Figure 5. We identified several clones that revealed varying degrees of c-CBL knockdown showing different sets of c-CBL lentiviral shRNA knockdown efficiency (Figure 5A). Of all the clones tested, Clone 27 was chosen for further experiments. Equal amount of cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and the cell proliferation was measured at various times and the results are depicted in Figure 5B. As expected, number of cells increased in a time dependent fashion from 100 to 190% relative to scrambled shRNA as control in a span of 48 h (pâ€Š=â€Š0.0002) (Figure 5B). The cell cycle phases in H358 cells that were knocked down with c-CBL shRNA were looked at and compared with the scrambled shRNA. There were no discernable differences between these two constructs in the different phases of the cell cycle (data not shown).

Go to: Discussion Our results demonstrate that c-CBL is somatically mutated (or has LOH) in lung cancers, and can significantly contribute to enhanced cell viability and motility. There was also a high prevalence of LOH with respect to c-CBL in lung tumors that harbored MET or EGFR mutation.  In the present study, we have demonstrated the occurrence of c-CBL mutations in lung cancer patients, especially with different ancestral variations. Mutations in c-CBL have been recently reported in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and myeloid malignancies. In the AML study, the mutation R420Q located in the junction of the RING finger and the linker region inhibited FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitination [20], thus contributing to the gain-in-function for the RTK. In addition, mutations such as H398Y, C384R, and L380P mapped to the RING finger domain and the linker region of c-CBL that is required for its E3 activity [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. Additionally, homozygous mutations in the RING finger domain of the c-CBL gene were described as a result of acquired Uniparental Disomy (UPD) [26]. It is important to note that our results indicate LOH at 11q23 locus and these are mutually exclusive from missense mutations of c-CBL. The somatic mutations were all heterozygous. The mutations in AML led to abrogation of the E3 activity leading to prolonged RTK activation. In addition mutants located on the linker region surrounding the RING finger domain exhibited enhanced AKT signaling in response to cytokine stimulation [26]. In addition, it was shown in NH3T3 cells, that neither mutations in the RING finger nor the linker region causes transformation, however while certain mutations perturbs the ubiquitination, others affect receptor recycling and prolong kinase activity [28].  We report here c-CBL mutations that mapped not only to the RING finger domain, but also to the TKB domain, proline-rich domain and the C-terminal region, but none mapped to the linker region as reported in the AML studies described above [23], [24], [25], [26], [29]. In addition, 8 mutants that we detected were found in different ethnic backgrounds. For example, S80N/H94Y, Q249E, W802* were detected in Caucasians, Taiwanese and African-Americans, respectively. The results point out not only the difference between lung cancer and other cancers, but also genetic polymorphism among different races in the same cancer. Interestingly, there is a large disparity between African-American and other ethnic populations with lung cancer [30]. We have previously shown that there was a low frequency of EGFR and MET mutation in African-Americans as compared with Taiwanese and Caucasians [31]. In this study, the number of African-American samples analyzed was relatively fewer and we found 3 mutations that are unique to this ethnicity. It would now behoove us to further study the genetic alterations that can occur and determine the targeted therapeutics for African-Americans. Our results provide evidence of the importance of c-CBL in tumorigenesis and potential signaling. Our prediction, based on the AML data, would be that the V391I RING finger domain mutation would affect the E3 activity. Also, it will be important to determine the binding partners for c-CBL in the TKB domain and proline rich domain mutations. It has previously been shown that the TKB domain can bind to growth factor receptors and it will be important to determine the cross-binding of these mutants to MET and or EGFR. It would also be important in the future to look at fluorescence in situ hybridization/copy number changes in c-CBL in lung cancer.  c-CBL plays an important role in down regulating RTK-mediated signaling through K63 poly-ubiquitination and subsequent downregulation of RTKs followed by lysosomal degredation [3]. Mono-ubiquitination or ubiquitinated with K63-linked chains of substrates by c-CBL may lead to enhancement of biological and biochemical functions (reviewed in Hermann et al, 2007 [32]). The mutations that we analyzed in our studies all point out to the fact that the E3 activity of c-CBL on EGFR is intact; the EGFR levels in the various mutants remain same (Figure S2). Multiple kinases, both RTKs and non-RTKs could be acted upon by c-CBL, including ERBs, PDGFR, FMS, MET, c-Kit, VEGFR, FLT-1, RON, FGFR, IR, as well as SYK, FYN, LCK, FGR, LYN and c-ABL [3]. In lung cancers the relevant substrates of c-CBL in terms of degradation or signal transduction are yet to be identified.  The observation that c-CBL somatic mutations, especially S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* showed increased cell viability and cell motility that is in agreement with the physiological role for D-cbl in the regulation of apoptosis and differentiation identified in Drosophila is very significant [33]. It has been previously shown that activating c-CBL mutation downregulates EGFR signaling and decreases cellular proliferation and migration in breast cancer cell lines [34]. Although the role of c-CBL in the negative regulation of RTKs is well substantiated, thereby suggesting that it is a natural tumor suppressor, studies in cancer cells have revealed both tumor suppressor and tumor promoting activities depending on the type of c-CBL mutation and the number of alleles at the c-CBL locus [24]. In agreement with the above, the three c-CBL mutants described here appear to have tumor growth and metastasis promoting properties. Although these mutants are outside of the RING finger or the linker region of c-CBL, their downstream effects are significant so as to cause increased proliferation and migration, but the substrate affected by these mutations are not known yet. This raises the possibility that some of the cellular functions of c-CBL are independent of its ubiquitin-ligase activity, an area that we are currently investigating. The oncogenic nature of RTKs, addiction of cancers to growth signals and given the clustering of c-CBL, EGFR and MET mutations, it is possible that the transforming effect of c-CBL mutations is most likely a combinatorial effect of the three. We also show that LOH for c-CBL was found in a significant number of samples that harbored MET or EGFR mutations. The fact that about 7% of lung tumor samples are likely to have c-CBL mutations and an additional 22% are likely to harbor c-CBL-related LOH, makes c-CBL a highly mutated molecule in lung cancer. Since LOH alone is not enough to cause a transforming event [35], [36], [37], associated mutation in the MET or EGFR locus or yet another RTK discussed above may play a role in carcinogenesis. We predict that this LOH in c-CBL results in haploinsufficiency that downplays RTK ubiquitination leading to hyperactivity of the RTKs. However, whether this is sufficient cause for tumorigenesis remains to be determined. Consistent with our hypothesis is the fact that c-cbl-/- mice have increased kinase activity in lymphocytes, but is not sufficient for tumor formation [35], [36], [37]. c-CBL LOH could also lead to increased expression of c-CBL from the other allele to compensate for a loss of an allele. Alternately, there could be some form of synergy working with reduced c-CBL levels and mutated receptors that exacerbate the phenotype of each alone.  Previous studies from our lab and others have shown that East Asians with lung cancers have relatively high frequencies of gain-of-function of mutations in RTKs such as EGFR and MET [31]. In a cohort of Japanese patients an activating MET mutation was identified in the splice region that deletes the juxtamembrane domain that is involved E3 activity of c-CBL [38]. This study also found that activation of MET is mutually exclusive of EGFR, KRAS and HER2 gene mutations [38]. We failed to detect such mutations in significant numbers in lung tumor samples obtained from African-Americans (nâ€Š=â€Š29) and Caucasian (nâ€Š=â€Š50) patients. One MET mutation was identified in each of the groups whereas 1 and 3 EGFR mutations were identified in the African-American and Caucasian cohorts respectively. EGFR mutations have earlier been identified as one of the key mutations affecting lung adenocarcinoma patients in a comprehensive study of 188 patients [39]. Our study encompasses different histologies of NSCLC. However, the published series did not find any mutations in c-CBL or MET unlike our study that encompassed different subtypes of NSCLC. It is important to note, we have recently shown that MET mutations in lung cancer are in majority germline [31]. We have reported earlier c-CBL mutations in a small cohort of Taiwanese lung cancer samples [40]. In our efforts to understand the ethnic differences in the lung oncogenome, we also looked at PAX transcription factors such as PAX5 and PAX8 that are highly expressed in lung cancers; however there was no preferential expression or mutations of the above genes in lung tumor samples of African-Americans. In this study, we show relatively high frequency of c-CBL mutations in lung cancers, especially in the large cell type among Caucasians and particularly among African-Americans. We therefore propose c-CBL as an efficacious target for lung cancers in African-Americans that needs to be further substantiated. This is all the more important because the prognosis for African-Americans with lung cancer, especially for men is much poorer compared to their Caucasian counterparts [41].  In conclusion, the results presented in this study demonstrate that c-CBL is frequently mutated or even lost in lung cancers. Our results support a role for c-CBL mutants that are independent of its ubiquitination activity. Given the relatively high mutation rates in c-CBL as well as RTKs such as MET and EGFR, it is likely that their combined effect could be synergistic in promoting tumorigenesis.  \n",

is a heterogeneous group of disorders with a number of genetic and proteomic alterations. c-CBL is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and adaptor molecule important in normal homeostasis and cancer. We determined the genetic variations of c-CBL, relationship to receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR and MET), and functionality in NSCLC.  Methods and Findings  Using archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) extracted genomic DNA, we show that c-CBL mutations occur in somatic fashion for lung cancers. c-CBL mutations were not mutually exclusive of MET or EGFR mutations; however they were independent of p53 and KRAS mutations. In normal/tumor pairwise analysis, there was significant loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for the c-CBL locus (22%, nâ€Š=â€Š8/37) and none of these samples revealed any mutation in the remaining copy of c-CBL. The c-CBL LOH also positively correlated with EGFR and MET mutations observed in the same samples. Using select c-CBL somatic mutations such as S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* (obtained from Caucasian, Taiwanese and African-American samples, respectively) transfected in NSCLC cell lines, there was increased cell viability and cell motility.  Conclusions  Taking the overall mutation rate of c-CBL to be a combination as somatic missense mutation and LOH, it is clear that c-CBL is highly mutated in lung cancers and may play an essential role in lung tumorigenesis and metastasis.  Go to: Introduction In the US alone, each year approximately 219,400 people are diagnosed with lung cancers, out of which more than 145,000 of them succumb to the disease [1]. This number is roughly equivalent to the combined mortality rates of cancers of the breast, prostate, colon, liver, kidney and melanoma [1]. In addition the prognosis is usually poor and the five-year survival rate is less than 15%. There are also significant ethnic differences for lung cancer, and the outcome is worse for blacks compared to whites. Gender differences are also striking with women having significantly better prognosis as compared to men. There are a number of genetic alterations that can occur in lung cancer. As an example, in NSCLC, mutations in KRAS, p53, EGFR and MET have been identified. Many of these pathways, especially Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) are controlled by c-CBL.  CBL (Casitas B-lineage lymphoma) is a mammalian gene located on human chromosome 11q23.3 [2] and is involved in cell signaling and protein ubiquitination [3]. CBL proteins belong to the RING finger class of ubiquitin ligases (E3) and there are three homologues c-CBL, CBL-b, CBL-3 [4]. The c-CBL and CBL-b genes are ubiquitously expressed with the highest levels in hematopoietic tissues [5]. c-CBL consists of four regions encoding for functionally distinct protein domains: the N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain, the linker region, the catalytic RING finger domain, the proline-rich region and the c-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain that also overlaps with a leucine-zipper (LZ) domain [3]. Both TKB and RING finger domains are essential for ligand-induced ubiquitination of RTKs [6], [7], [8], [9]. The RING finger domain is required for the recruitment of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. The TKB domain includes four-helix bundle (4H), a calcium-biding EF hand, and a modified SH2 domain, which binds to phosphotyrosine residues [3], [10], [11], [12]. In addition, the proline-rich region of c-CBL can associate with the SH3 domain of Grb2, which can indirectly recruit c-CBL to RTKs via the GRB2 adaptor protein [7], [13], [14].  c-CBL also binds to EGFR and acts as the E3 that targets EGFR for ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, CBL desensitizes EGF signaling and opposes cellular proliferation induced by EGF [15]. EGF activation also appears to activate the tyrosine kinase SRC, which phosphorylates c-CBL and in turn activates the ubiquitination and degradation of EGFR [16], [17], [18]. A recent study shows that defective endocytosis of EGFR is characterized by a deletion mutant and the point mutation L858R, whereby its association with c-CBL and subsequent ubiquitination are impaired [19]. Recently, the first human c-CBL mutations were reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients [20]. The mutation R420Q inhibits FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitination [20].  Not only can E3 activity be important in oncogenesis, c-CBL has a dual but separate function as a signal transduction molecule. We have previously shown that c-CBL is important in binding CRKL and BCR/ABL in hematopoietic cells. Also, it can bind and modulate functions of cytoskeleton by binding to proteins like talin and paxillin. The TKB domain is important in binding to a number of molecules, and they then function in signal transduction.  Given the critical role of CBL in normal homeostasis and cancer, we hypothesized that it might be mutated in lung cancers. In this study, we report novel c-CBL somatic mutations S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* in Caucasian, Taiwanese and African-American lung cancer patients, respectively. Expressing these mutations in NSCLC cell lines lead to increased proliferation and cell motility. We show that c-CBL mutations occur with or without MET or EGFR mutations but are mutually exclusive of a LOH at the c-CBL locus. Additionally, c-CBL LOH is associated with either MET or EGFR mutations. We thus hypothesize that c-CBL mutations might contribute to the oncogenic potential of MET and EGFR in lung cancer.  Go to: Methods Ethics Statement  Written consent on all research on human subjects has been obtained from the Institutional Review Board, University of Chicago and covers all research performed in the laboratory. The following is their contact information: Institutional Review Board, The University of Chicago, McGiffert Hall, 5751 S. Woodlawn Ave., 2nd floor, Chicago, IL 60637. Written informed consents were received from all patients whose tissue samples were used for this study.  Tissue Samples  Lung cancer tissue and paired adjacent normal lung tissues were obtained from 50 Caucasian, 29 African-Americans and 40 Taiwanese NSCLC patients who were recruited at the University of Chicago Hospital (Chicago, USA) (Caucasian and African-American patients) and Taipei Veterans General Hospital of Taiwan (Taiwanese patients) after obtaining appropriate Institutional Review Board permission and informed consent from the patients. Out of 119 samples, 77 were men, 38 were women and 4 were unknown with age at diagnosis ranging from 47 to 90 years. In terms of tumor types, 53 were adenocarcinoma, 32 were squamous cell carcinoma and 34 were large cell carcinoma. 49 were stage I, 14 were stage II, 34 were stage III, and 13 were stage IV (Table S1).  Cell Culture  Human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells A549 and H358 were maintained in DMEM and RPMI-1640, respectively. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in DMEM. Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 Âµg/ml of streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were cultured at 37Â°C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.  c-CBL Gene Mutational Analysis  Exons 2 to 16 of c-CBL gene were individually amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers are listed in Table S2. PCR conditions were 1 cycle of 95Â°C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles of 94Â°C for 30 seconds, 58Â°C for 30 seconds and 72Â°C for 2 minutes; and one cycle of 72Â°C for 10 minutes. PCR products were treated with ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH) and sequenced by Big-Dye Terminator Chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequencing was performed on the forward coding strand with confirmation of c-CBL alterations performed by sequencing the reverse strand as well. Chromatograms were analyzed for mutations using Mutation Surveyor v2.61 (Softgenetics, State College, PA).  Plasmid Constructs and Site-Directed Mutagenesis  The wild-type c-CBL cDNA insert was subcloned into the pAlterMax expression vector using XhoI and SalI restriction enzyme sites (Promega, Madison, WI). Using this parental plasmid pAlterMax-c-CBL, the TKB domain double mutation (S80N/H94Y), the point mutation (Q249E), and the C-terminal point mutation W802* of c-CBL were created using the following primers: 5â€²-GCTGGCGCTAAAGAATAACCCACCTTATATCTTAGAC-3â€² and 5â€²-CTACCAGATACCTACCAGTATCTCCGTACTATCTTGTC-3â€² for the double mutation S80N/H94Y; 5â€²-CTTTACCCGACTCTTTGAGCCCTGGTCCTCTTTGC-3â€² for Q249E, and 5â€²-CAGCTCCTCCTTTGGCTGATTGTCTCTGGATGGTGATC-3â€² for W802* along with their complementary primers using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis XL kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The constructs were confirmed for the point mutations by standard DNA sequencing of both strands.  Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) Analysis  Five microsatellites on chromosome 11 (3 on 11q at or within 200 kb up or downstream of the c-CBL gene and 2 control markers on 11p) were selected for analysis (Table S3). Established microsatellite markers and respective primer sequences were selected from the GeneLoc database (http://genecards.weizmann.ac.il/geneloc/index.shtml, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel). Primers were custom designed and each forward primer was fluorescently labeled at the 5â€² end with FAM, PET, NED, or VIC (Applied Biosystems). Primer annealing temperatures and duplex scores were evaluated with NIST Primer Tools (http://yellow.nist.gov:8444/dnaAnalysis/primerToolsPage.do; National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD). Primers were verified by performing PCR with control DNA (isolated from TK6 cells) and resolving the products on agarose gels. Bands were visualized with an UV transilluminator. Genomic DNA was extracted from tumor samples and paired normal lung tissue. Primers were grouped into multiplex combinations shown in Table S4. Marker D11S929 served as an internal control to check for consistency in PCRs and of peaks from capillary electrophoresis. Multiplex PCRs were carried out in a volume of 10 ÂµL that contained 1 ÂµL genomic DNA (20â€“50 ng), 0.5 ÂµM of each primer (1.0 ÂµM total for each primer pair), 400 ÂµM dNTPs, 1X PCR buffer containing MgCl2, and 0.2 U Taq DNA polymerase. PCR was performed on the ABI GeneAmp 9700 PCR System under the following conditions: 5 min at 94Â°C; 30 cycles of 30 sec at 94Â°C, 1 min at 60Â°C, 1 min at 72Â°C; and 5 min at 72Â°C. The PCR products were separated by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI 3130XL DNA Analyzer. Chromatograms were analyzed with Peak Scanner 1.0 and GeneMapper 3.7 software (Applied Biosystems) for allelic alterations. The area of the peaks produced by the DNA PCR products was quantified for each allele. The ratio of the allelic areas was calculated for each tumor and paired normal DNA sample. When the qLOH (allelic ratio for the tumor peaks divided by the allelic ratio of paired normal sample) was â‰¤0.5 or â‰¥2.0 for c-CBL and at least one other 11q marker in at least two separate experiments, the sample was considered as having an allelic imbalance and interpreted as LOH. Samples were evaluated in at least two separate experiments and samples showing prospective LOH at c-CBL repeated a third time which included a new control marker at the BAX locus (data not shown) on chromosome 19 to verify integrity of sample DNA.  Transfection of c-Cbl Constructs  The A549 cell line was transfected using the Fugene HD (Roche, Nutley, NJ) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eight Âµg of plasmid DNA, containing either no insert (empty vector), wild-type c-CBL, S80N/H94Y c-CBL, Q249E c-CBL or W802* CBL was used for transfection in a 6-well culture plate. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and analyzed for expression.  c-CBL Knockdown  c-CBL knockdown was performed using lentiviral transduction using MISSION lentiviral transduction particles (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as per manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1Ã—105 H358 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates and infected the following day with c-CBL lentiviral shRNA constructs. To generate stable c-CBL knockdown cell lines, cells were selected for 2 days with 1 Âµg/ml puromycin. c-CBL levels were determined using whole cell lysates by immunoblotting with anti-CBL antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA).  Cell Viability Assay  Cells were transfected as described above in the transfection assay. Forty-eight hours after transfection, viability of cells was assessed using Trypan Blue exclusion.  Wound Healing Assay  A549 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured for 48 h until 100% confluent. The medium was then changed and the cells were transfected as described in the transfection assay. Twelve hours after transfection, a straight scratch was made across the cell layer using a 1 ml pipette tip. The cells were then gently washed with 1Ã— PBS to remove cellular debris and the media was replaced. Photographs were taken of the wound region every 12 h until 48 h.  Western Blot Analysis  Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were collected and washed twice in 1X PBS, then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5M Tris-HCl with pH 7.4, 1.5 M NaCl, 2.5% deoxycholic acid, 10 mM EDTA, 10% NP-40, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 Âµg/mL leupeptin, and 10 Âµg/mL aprotinin) for 5 minutes. The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4Â°C, and protein content of the supernatant was measured. Total cell lysates (50 Âµg/well) were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and the gels transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman, Piscataway, NJ). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing Tween-20 (PBST) (1X PBS, 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody at 4Â°C overnight. Membranes then were washed three times with PBST and probed with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were again washed three times in PBST and bands were visualized using Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (BioRad, Valencia, CA) on a Chemidoc Gel documentation system (BioRad, Valencia, CA). Antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies and used at the following dilutions (c-CBL, 1âˆ¶5000; c-MET, 1âˆ¶5000; EGFR, 1âˆ¶5000; ubiquitin, 1âˆ¶1000; HA, 1âˆ¶5000 and Î²-actin, 1âˆ¶10,000).  Flow Cytometry  Cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow cytometry. Approximately 2Ã—106 cells were grown in media containing 10% FBS. Cells were harvested by trypsin/EDTA treatment, washed with 1X PBS three times and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 2 h. Cells were washed again with cold PBS and stained with a solution containing 25 Âµg/mL propidium iodide, 200 Âµg/mL RNase A, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes in the dark. Cell cycle analysis was performed using a Guava PCA-96 flow cytometer (Guava Technologies, Millipore, Billerica, MA).  Ubiquitin Ligase Activity  293T cells were maintained in culture in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin (100 units/mL) and streptomycin (100 Âµg/mL) were transfected with 0.2 Âµg EGFR-pcDNA3 and 2 Âµg HA-tagged c-CBL constructs as indicated using calcium phosphate according to manufacturer's protocol (Profection, Promega, Madison, WI). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were starved overnight in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS, and then treated with or without EGF (100 ng/ml) for 15 min. The cells were collected and washed two times in ice-cold PBS containing 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X100, 10% Glycerol, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors). Lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 10 min at 4Â°C. EGFR immunoprecipitations were performed on 200 Âµg of cleared lysate using 250 ng of rabbit-anti-EGFR and Protein A/G Plus Sepharose overnight at 4Â°C. Precipitations were washed 5 times in lysis buffer before boiling in Laemmli buffer. Elutions were immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin and EGFR. Twenty micrograms of cleared lysate were immunoblotted for each of the c-CBL constructs using anti-HA.  Statistical Analysis  Mutation rates between different groups were compared using Fisher's exact test. For continuous variables, group comparisons were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Sidak's adjustment for multiple comparisons. Experiments involving repeated measurements over time were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with the Greenhouse-Geisser adjustment to the degrees of freedom. Analyses were conducted using STATA (v10.1) software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).  Go to: Results c-CBL Gene Mutations in Lung Cancer  To investigate the role of c-CBL in lung cancer, we analyzed its genomic DNA in tumor and paired normal samples drawn from multiple ethnicities. The lung tumor samples represented Caucasians (nâ€Š=â€Š50), African-Americans (nâ€Š=â€Š29), and Taiwanese (nâ€Š=â€Š40) lung cancer patients. We designed 12 pairs of primers to sequence the coding region of c-CBL gene that spans exons 2 to 16 (Table S2). We identified 8 unique somatic mutations in c-CBL exons among 8 different patients. A variation L620F, a known SNP (rs2227988) in exon 11 was also detected. Importantly, the eight novel non-synonymous mutations were confirmed by sequencing both strands of c-CBL genomic DNA obtained from lung tumor samples (Table 1). Moreover, none of the 8 mutations were detected in the corresponding normal tissue, indicating that these were somatic mutations. Four synonymous single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were also identified but were not used further in this study.  Table 1 Table 1 c-CBL mutation analysis in 119 lung cancer patient tumor tissues. Three of the 8 novel non-synonymous mutations were located in the TKB (tyrosine kinase binding) domain (S80N, H94Y, and Q249E), one in the RING finger domain (V391I), one in the proline-rich region (72515_72517 del ATG), and three in the C-terminal region (W802*, R830K, and A848T) of the c-CBL protein (Figure 1A and Figure S1). In Figure 1B, we show model chromatograms of representative samples.  Figure 1 Figure 1 c-CBL mutations and LOH in non-small cell lung cancer. 11q LOH of c-CBL Gene  Paired lung tumor and normal lung tissue samples from Taiwanese patients (nâ€Š=â€Š37) were investigated for LOH. Eight (21.6%) showed LOH at the c-CBL locus on chromosome 11 while 29 samples (78.4%) revealed normal allelic contribution at the microsatellite markers (Figures 1C and D).  c-CBL Mutations in Different Ethnic Groups  The c-CBL double mutant S80N/H94Y was found in the same patient and the overall mutation rate for c-CBL in lung tumors was 6.7% (8/119). The frequency of c-CBL mutation was highest in large cell carcinoma (14.7%; 5 of 34 patients) followed by squamous carcinoma (6.3%; 2 of 32 patients) and the least was observed in adenocarcinoma (AD) (1.8%; 1 of 53 patients), although these rates were not statistically significant (pâ€Š=â€Š0.292). Mutation rates were 6.0% among Caucasians (0 of 20 in AD; 0 of 10 in SQ; and 3 of 20 in LC), 13.8% in African-Americans (1 of 10 in AD; 1 of 10 in SQ; and 2 of 9 in LC), and 2.5% (0 of 23 in AD; 1 of 12 in SQ; and 0 of 5 in LC) in the Taiwanese population. Additionally two Taiwanese patients with lung cancer (one squamous and one adenocarcinoma) had the known SNP L620F. Ethnic differences were not statistically significant, however the power to detect differences was low.  Mutations in MET and EGFR Can Be Co-Associated with c-CBL Alterations  Since East Asians with lung cancer have a higher frequency of EGFR and MET mutations in lung tumors [21], [22], we also determined mutations in EGFR and MET in the same Taiwanese cohort samples and compared the results with the observed c-CBL alterations (LOH and/or mutations). In the 37 samples tested, we did not find any overlap between c-CBL mutations and c-CBL LOH (Figure 2). Of the three c-CBL mutants (including the known L620F SNP, rs2227988), one of the samples had a MET mutation (N375S) and the other had an EGFR mutation (L858R). Among the 8 samples that had a LOH at the c-CBL locus 5 had an additional mutation in MET (N375S) and 2 had an EGFR exon 19 deletion. Twenty-six samples had neither c-CBL mutation nor c-CBL LOH (3 patients had a c-CBL mutation but no c-CBL LOH). Among these 26 samples 9 had a MET mutation (8 N375S, 1 L211W), 13 had an EGFR mutation (7 exon 9 deletion, 6 L858R) and 4 had no other MET or EGFR mutation. Thus the rate of MET or EGFR mutations among patients with LOH at the c-CBL locus (7 of 8) was similar to that seen in patients without c-CBL mutation or LOH (22 of 26 patients) (pâ€Š=â€Š0.99). These 4 patients with no identifiable mutation in c-CBL, MET or EGFR represented 10.8% of the 37 patients analyzed in the Taiwanese patient cohort. Conversely, 89.2% Taiwanese lung cancer patients have an identifiable mutation in either c-CBL, MET or EGFR or a combination of the three genes (Figure 2). Additionally, we determined p53 and KRAS mutations in these Taiwanese cohorts. Two p53 and 1 KRAS mutation were detected. The single KRAS mutation overlapped with one p53 mutation. This patient also had the EGFR exon 19 deletion but had no c-CBL mutation. The other p53 mutation sample had a c-CBL LOH with concurrent MET N375S mutation. Thus, in the Taiwanese samples analyzed, p53/KRAS mutations and c-CBL mutations were mutually exclusive (data not shown).  Figure 2 Figure 2 c-CBL mutations and relationship to MET and EGFR mutations in lung cancer. Cellular Functions of c-CBL Alterations in the Context of Lung Tumorigenesis  A. E3 activity is intact in the mutant c-CBL proteins To investigate whether the different c-CBL mutations affect the E3 activity, EGFR was chosen as a model substrate for c-CBL E3 function. All of the c-CBL mutants tested enhanced ubiquitination of the activated EGFR similar to the wild-type c-CBL protein. This result demonstrates that the catalytic activity of the c-CBL mutants is not impaired when EGFR was the substrate. (Figure 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Ubiquitination, viability, expression and cell cycle analysis of various c-CBL mutants. B. Effect on lung cancer cell viability The effect of a representative c-CBL mutant from each of the three ethnic backgrounds on lung cancer cell viability in cell lines was determined. S80N/H94Y double mutation, Q249E, and W802* were identified in lung tumor samples obtained from a Caucasian, a Taiwanese and an African-American, respectively. As described in methods, the c-CBL wild-type (WT) and the above three mutants were expressed after cloning them into pAlterMax vector in A549 cells. These cells express relatively low basal levels of endogenous c-CBL (data not shown). Transfection efficiency was comparable between different groups and the number of cells transfected with c-CBL wild-type construct was about 70% compared to control cells that were transfected with the empty vector. Cells transfected with S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* c-CBL mutant constructs resulted in increased number of viable cells that was 132.3%, 120.8% and 147.9% higher respectively, relative to the empty vector control transfected cells and significantly different from the wild-type construct (pâ€Š=â€Š0.022, pâ€Š=â€Š0.049, and pâ€Š=â€Š0.008, respectively) (Figure 3B). Relative levels of c-CBL protein in whole cell lysates prepared from samples obtained from a parallel experiment was determined. The c-CBL protein levels in samples representing untransfected and empty vector transfected cells were comparable and those representing the c-CBL WT and the three c-CBL mutants were comparable (Figure 3C).  C. Effect on cell cycle To investigate if the increases in cell viability in different c-CBL mutants are due to increased cellular proliferation, a cell cycle analysis was performed. A549 cells were transfected with the c-CBL WT or the three different mutants: S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802*. The empty vector transfectant was used as a control. Forty-eight hours after transfection cell cycle analysis was performed as described in materials and methods. There was no significant change in the subG1, G1 or the S phase of the cell cycle among the different mutants compared to the WT construct (pâ€Š=â€Š0.64, pâ€Š=â€Š0.40, and pâ€Š=â€Š0.28, respectively). The G2/M phase of the cell cycle showed an increase in cell numbers for the three mutants, S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802*, when compared to the WT but again the difference was not statistically significant (pâ€Š=â€Š0.25) (Figure 3D).  D. Effect on cell motility To investigate the effect of the expression of the above three c-CBL mutants on cell migration, we carried out wound healing assay as described in materials and methods. The closing of the scratch or the wound was monitored at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. (Figure 4A). In all the samples, that represented cells transfected with mutants, the wound gap was much smaller than that seen in the sample that represented cells transfected with c-CBL WT (p<0.001). We also determined the rate of wound closure for all the five groups. At 48 h, wild-type c-CBL transfectants showed 61.1% open wound while the S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* mutants showed 18.7%, 23.9% and 34.3% open wound respectively (p<0.001) (Figure 4B).  Figure 4 Figure 4 c-CBL mutations affect wound healing in A549 cells. E. c-CBL knockdown increases cell viability It is hypothesized that the LOH seen in our samples could lead to decreased expression of c-CBL. Thus we tested the effect of c-CBL knockdown in lung cancer cells. Compared to A549, H358 lung cancer cells express relatively high levels of endogenous c-CBL (data not shown). c-CBL expression was knocked down using lentiviral construct that expressed c-CBL specific shRNA and compared the results with those that were transduced with scrambled shRNA and the results are shown in Figure 5. We identified several clones that revealed varying degrees of c-CBL knockdown showing different sets of c-CBL lentiviral shRNA knockdown efficiency (Figure 5A). Of all the clones tested, Clone 27 was chosen for further experiments. Equal amount of cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and the cell proliferation was measured at various times and the results are depicted in Figure 5B. As expected, number of cells increased in a time dependent fashion from 100 to 190% relative to scrambled shRNA as control in a span of 48 h (pâ€Š=â€Š0.0002) (Figure 5B). The cell cycle phases in H358 cells that were knocked down with c-CBL shRNA were looked at and compared with the scrambled shRNA. There were no discernable differences between these two constructs in the different phases of the cell cycle (data not shown).  Figure 5 Figure 5 Knockdown of c-CBL using an shRNA increases cell proliferation. Go to: Discussion Our results demonstrate that c-CBL is somatically mutated (or has LOH) in lung cancers, and can significantly contribute to enhanced cell viability and motility. There was also a high prevalence of LOH with respect to c-CBL in lung tumors that harbored MET or EGFR mutation.  In the present study, we have demonstrated the occurrence of c-CBL mutations in lung cancer patients, especially with different ancestral variations. Mutations in c-CBL have been recently reported in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and myeloid malignancies. In the AML study, the mutation R420Q located in the junction of the RING finger and the linker region inhibited FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitination [20], thus contributing to the gain-in-function for the RTK. In addition, mutations such as H398Y, C384R, and L380P mapped to the RING finger domain and the linker region of c-CBL that is required for its E3 activity [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. Additionally, homozygous mutations in the RING finger domain of the c-CBL gene were described as a result of acquired Uniparental Disomy (UPD) [26]. It is important to note that our results indicate LOH at 11q23 locus and these are mutually exclusive from missense mutations of c-CBL. The somatic mutations were all heterozygous. The mutations in AML led to abrogation of the E3 activity leading to prolonged RTK activation. In addition mutants located on the linker region surrounding the RING finger domain exhibited enhanced AKT signaling in response to cytokine stimulation [26]. In addition, it was shown in NH3T3 cells, that neither mutations in the RING finger nor the linker region causes transformation, however while certain mutations perturbs the ubiquitination, others affect receptor recycling and prolong kinase activity [28].  We report here c-CBL mutations that mapped not only to the RING finger domain, but also to the TKB domain, proline-rich domain and the C-terminal region, but none mapped to the linker region as reported in the AML studies described above [23], [24], [25], [26], [29]. In addition, 8 mutants that we detected were found in different ethnic backgrounds. For example, S80N/H94Y, Q249E, W802* were detected in Caucasians, Taiwanese and African-Americans, respectively. The results point out not only the difference between lung cancer and other cancers, but also genetic polymorphism among different races in the same cancer. Interestingly, there is a large disparity between African-American and other ethnic populations with lung cancer [30]. We have previously shown that there was a low frequency of EGFR and MET mutation in African-Americans as compared with Taiwanese and Caucasians [31]. In this study, the number of African-American samples analyzed was relatively fewer and we found 3 mutations that are unique to this ethnicity. It would now behoove us to further study the genetic alterations that can occur and determine the targeted therapeutics for African-Americans. Our results provide evidence of the importance of c-CBL in tumorigenesis and potential signaling. Our prediction, based on the AML data, would be that the V391I RING finger domain mutation would affect the E3 activity. Also, it will be important to determine the binding partners for c-CBL in the TKB domain and proline rich domain mutations. It has previously been shown that the TKB domain can bind to growth factor receptors and it will be important to determine the cross-binding of these mutants to MET and or EGFR. It would also be important in the future to look at fluorescence in situ hybridization/copy number changes in c-CBL in lung cancer.  c-CBL plays an important role in down regulating RTK-mediated signaling through K63 poly-ubiquitination and subsequent downregulation of RTKs followed by lysosomal degredation [3]. Mono-ubiquitination or ubiquitinated with K63-linked chains of substrates by c-CBL may lead to enhancement of biological and biochemical functions (reviewed in Hermann et al, 2007 [32]). The mutations that we analyzed in our studies all point out to the fact that the E3 activity of c-CBL on EGFR is intact; the EGFR levels in the various mutants remain same (Figure S2). Multiple kinases, both RTKs and non-RTKs could be acted upon by c-CBL, including ERBs, PDGFR, FMS, MET, c-Kit, VEGFR, FLT-1, RON, FGFR, IR, as well as SYK, FYN, LCK, FGR, LYN and c-ABL [3]. In lung cancers the relevant substrates of c-CBL in terms of degradation or signal transduction are yet to be identified.  The observation that c-CBL somatic mutations, especially S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* showed increased cell viability and cell motility that is in agreement with the physiological role for D-cbl in the regulation of apoptosis and differentiation identified in Drosophila is very significant [33]. It has been previously shown that activating c-CBL mutation downregulates EGFR signaling and decreases cellular proliferation and migration in breast cancer cell lines [34]. Although the role of c-CBL in the negative regulation of RTKs is well substantiated, thereby suggesting that it is a natural tumor suppressor, studies in cancer cells have revealed both tumor suppressor and tumor promoting activities depending on the type of c-CBL mutation and the number of alleles at the c-CBL locus [24]. In agreement with the above, the three c-CBL mutants described here appear to have tumor growth and metastasis promoting properties. Although these mutants are outside of the RING finger or the linker region of c-CBL, their downstream effects are significant so as to cause increased proliferation and migration, but the substrate affected by these mutations are not known yet. This raises the possibility that some of the cellular functions of c-CBL are independent of its ubiquitin-ligase activity, an area that we are currently investigating. The oncogenic nature of RTKs, addiction of cancers to growth signals and given the clustering of c-CBL, EGFR and MET mutations, it is possible that the transforming effect of c-CBL mutations is most likely a combinatorial effect of the three. We also show that LOH for c-CBL was found in a significant number of samples that harbored MET or EGFR mutations. The fact that about 7% of lung tumor samples are likely to have c-CBL mutations and an additional 22% are likely to harbor c-CBL-related LOH, makes c-CBL a highly mutated molecule in lung cancer. Since LOH alone is not enough to cause a transforming event [35], [36], [37], associated mutation in the MET or EGFR locus or yet another RTK discussed above may play a role in carcinogenesis. We predict that this LOH in c-CBL results in haploinsufficiency that downplays RTK ubiquitination leading to hyperactivity of the RTKs. However, whether this is sufficient cause for tumorigenesis remains to be determined. Consistent with our hypothesis is the fact that c-cbl-/- mice have increased kinase activity in lymphocytes, but is not sufficient for tumor formation [35], [36], [37]. c-CBL LOH could also lead to increased expression of c-CBL from the other allele to compensate for a loss of an allele. Alternately, there could be some form of synergy working with reduced c-CBL levels and mutated receptors that exacerbate the phenotype of each alone.  Previous studies from our lab and others have shown that East Asians with lung cancers have relatively high frequencies of gain-of-function of mutations in RTKs such as EGFR and MET [31]. In a cohort of Japanese patients an activating MET mutation was identified in the splice region that deletes the juxtamembrane domain that is involved E3 activity of c-CBL [38]. This study also found that activation of MET is mutually exclusive of EGFR, KRAS and HER2 gene mutations [38]. We failed to detect such mutations in significant numbers in lung tumor samples obtained from African-Americans (nâ€Š=â€Š29) and Caucasian (nâ€Š=â€Š50) patients. One MET mutation was identified in each of the groups whereas 1 and 3 EGFR mutations were identified in the African-American and Caucasian cohorts respectively. EGFR mutations have earlier been identified as one of the key mutations affecting lung adenocarcinoma patients in a comprehensive study of 188 patients [39]. Our study encompasses different histologies of NSCLC. However, the published series did not find any mutations in c-CBL or MET unlike our study that encompassed different subtypes of NSCLC. It is important to note, we have recently shown that MET mutations in lung cancer are in majority germline [31]. We have reported earlier c-CBL mutations in a small cohort of Taiwanese lung cancer samples [40]. In our efforts to understand the ethnic differences in the lung oncogenome, we also looked at PAX transcription factors such as PAX5 and PAX8 that are highly expressed in lung cancers; however there was no preferential expression or mutations of the above genes in lung tumor samples of African-Americans. In this study, we show relatively high frequency of c-CBL mutations in lung cancers, especially in the large cell type among Caucasians and particularly among African-Americans. We therefore propose c-CBL as an efficacious target for lung cancers in African-Americans that needs to be further substantiated. This is all the more important because the prognosis for African-Americans with lung cancer, especially for men is much poorer compared to their Caucasian counterparts [41].  In conclusion, the results presented in this study demonstrate that c-CBL is frequently mutated or even lost in lung cancers. Our results support a role for c-CBL mutants that are independent of its ubiquitination activity. Given the relatively high mutation rates in c-CBL as well as RTKs such as MET and EGFR, it is likely that their combined effect could be synergistic in promoting tumorigenesis.  \n",

may be reduced to homozygosity. To help identify novel mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), we performed a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) screen to identify aUPD in 58 patients with atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML; n = 30), JAK2 mutationâ€“negative myelofibrosis (MF; n = 18), or JAK2 mutationâ€“negative polycythemia vera (PV; n = 10). Stretches of homozygous, copy neutral SNP calls greater than 20Mb were seen in 10 (33%) aCML and 1 (6%) MF, but were absent in PV. In total, 7 different chromosomes were involved with 7q and 11q each affected in 10% of aCML cases. CBL mutations were identified in all 3 cases with 11q aUPD and analysis of 574 additional MPNs revealed a total of 27 CBL variants in 26 patients with aCML, myelofibrosis or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Most variants were missense substitutions in the RING or linker domains that abrogated CBL ubiquitin ligase activity and conferred a proliferative advantage to 32D cells overexpressing FLT3. We conclude that acquired, transforming CBL mutations are a novel and widespread pathogenetic abnormality in morphologically related, clinically aggressive MPNs.  Introduction  Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by overproliferation of one or more myeloid cell lineages in the bone marrow and increased numbers of mature and immature myeloid cells in the peripheral blood. Excess proliferation is frequently associated with splenomegaly and cardiovascular complications as well as increased risk of transformation to acute leukemia. MPNs are categorized into subtypes based on specific morphologic, hematologic, and laboratory parameters, the best characterized being the 4 so-called classic MPNs: polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis (MF), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).1 In addition, several atypical MPNs are recognized, some of which show both dysplastic and proliferative features, such as atypical, BCR-ABL negative CML (aCML).2  MPNs are associated with acquired, activating mutations or gene fusions of tyrosine kinases, abnormalities that are believed to be critical drivers of excess proliferation as a result of deregulated or constitutive signaling.3 The 2 most prominent examples are BCR-ABL in CML4 and the V617F JAK2 mutation in PV, ET, and MF,5â‡“â‡“â€“8 but more than 40 variant tyrosine kinase fusions have been identified in MPNs as well as other mutations in JAK2 and FLT3.2 Activating mutations have been described in components that signal upstream (eg, MPL) or downstream (eg, NRAS) of tyrosine kinases9,10; however, the molecular pathogenesis of the majority of atypical MPNs and approximately 50% of ET and MF cases remains obscure.  V617F JAK2 was initially identified by several different routes, one of which was based on the observation that many PV patients show evidence of acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD) at chromosome 9p.11,12 Regions of aUPD exhibit loss of heterozygosity (LOH) compared with constitutional DNA without change of copy number and arise by mitotic recombination followed by selection for one of the products. After the initial observations in PV, it has emerged that aUPD is common in both hematologic and epithelial malignancies, and is associated with known oncogenic changes in a variety of genes within the affected regions.13 In this study we set out to determine whether aUPD characterizes MPNs of unknown molecular etiology and, if so, whether it could be used as a tool to help identify novel driver mutations.  Methods  Patients  Peripheral blood or bone marrow samples were received from patients diagnosed with an MPN or other hematologic malignancy according to standard morphologic, hematologic, and laboratory criteria. Clinical data were available from a subset of these cases. The study was approved by the Internal Review Boards from participating institutions and informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.  SNP array analysis  DNA labeling and hybridization to Affymetrix 50k XbaI chips was performed at the Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum fÃ¼r Genomforschung (RZPD, Berlin, Germany). Raw data were imported into the Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software, analyzed using Affymetrix (High Wycombe, United Kingdom) GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE 4.1) and copy number analysis tool (CNAT). Data were exported to custom-designed spreadsheets that display loss of heterozygosity and copy number changes in ideogram format. Data were also analyzed using Affymetrix Genotyping Console (version 2.1). Overall, a median of 98.2% (range, 91.5%-99.6%) of SNPs gave readable calls.  Mutation analysis  Detection of mutations by high resolution melting (HRM) analysis was performed as described14 using a Rotor-Gene 6000 (Corbett Life Sciences, St Neots, United Kingdom). Direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products was performed by standard techniques on an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, United Kingdom) and analyzed using Mutation Surveyor (SoftGenetics, State College, PA). CBL mutations are numbered relative to the ATG (A = 1) in the Ensembl cDNA sequence ENSG00000110395. A dropping factor (relative intensity drop of the wild-type allele peak relative to that seen in a concurrently run normal sample) of 60% or more was considered indicative of a biallelic mutation whereas a dropping factor of less than 60% was considered as monoallelic. Primer sequences for CBL exon 8 were CBL_i7f (5â€²-tgtggtttcactttaaaccctgga-3â€²) and CBL_i8r (5â€²-gccaggccaccccttgtatc-3â€²) and for CBL exon 9 were CBL_i8f (5â€²-ggcctggcttttgggttagg-3â€²) and CBL_i9r (5â€²-cacaatggattttgccagtctcc-3â€²). CBL reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was performed on random hexamerâ€“reverse transcribed RNA using primers CBLe7F: 5â€²-gaatcctgatctgactggcttatg-3â€² and CBLe10R 5â€²-gctgcggcagaaggtcaagt-3â€². Other primer sequences are available on request.  Microsatellite analysis  DNA samples were amplified with a series of fluorescently labeled primer pairs flanking highly polymorphic microsatellite markers on chromosome 11q as described.10 aUPD was scored if 4 or more consecutive markers encompassing CBL were homozygous without change in allelic copy number (P < .05 of this occurring in the absence of aUPD based on published rates of heterozygosity). Copy number at 11q was estimated by multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) using the Marfan probeset 1 (P065; MRC Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), a kit that contains four 11q control probes including one at 11q23.3.  Constructs  pMY-wtCBL and pMY-CBLR420Q express wild-type and R420Q CBL, respectively, along with green fluorescent protein (GFP).15 Other CBL mutant constructs were derived from pMY-wtCBL using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). pAL/FLT3 and pCMVâ€“HA ubiquitin have also been described previously.15  Cell lines  The IL-3â€“dependent murine myeloid cell 32Dcl3 (32D) was purchased from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (Braunschweig, Germany) and was maintained in 90% RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% WEHI-3B conditioned medium (WEHI). All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37Â°C and 5% carbon dioxide. 32D cells were stably transduced by electroporation with wt-FLT3 in a pAL vector as previously described16 and maintained in 15 ng/mL blastocidin (Invitrogen, Paisley United Kingdom). The Platinum-E (Plat-E) retrovirus packaging cell line17 was transfected using the calcium phosphate method with 5 Î¼g CBL construct DNA: 106 32D/wtFLT3 cells were cocultivated with the Plat-E cells for 48 hours in a volume of 2 mL (50% RPMI, 50% DMEM, 10% FBS, 5% WEHI). GFP positive cells were flow sorted to highest possible purity using a BD FACSAria cell sorter (Becton Dickinson, Stanford, CA). If insufficient cells were obtained for experiments after flow sorting, the cells were maintained in culture and resorted to greater than 95% purity.  Growth factor withdrawal assays  Cell growth was compared with wt-FLT3, vector-only transfected cells and the parental 32D line in stably transfected cells. Cells (105/mL) were grown over 3 days in triplicate for each CBL mutant and a wt-CBL control in 96-well plates. Cultures were analyzed daily for proliferation using the Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (MTS assay; Promega, Southampton, United Kingdom). All experiments were performed at least 3 times independently and results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).  Ubiquitin ligase activity  The ubiquitin ligase activity of CBL mutants in comparison to wild-type CBL was determined by transiently transfecting 107 32D/wtFLT3 cells expressing wild-type or CBL mutants by electroporation with 20 Î¼g pCMV-HA ubiquitin. Cells were maintained in culture with WEHI for 12 hours after transfection before being washed, serum deprived overnight, exposed to FLT3 ligand for 10 minutes, and lysed in buffer as described.18 Lysates were incubated with a FLT3-specific polyclonal antibody overnight at 4Â°C. Protein G agarose beads (100 Î¼L) were added and incubated at 4Â°C for 4 hours. The beads were washed 4 times in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer. The supernatant was mixed with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) sample loading buffer before immunoblot analyses with antibodies against HA-ubiquitin (sc-805; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), CBL (2111C3a; Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), and FLT3 (sc-479; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA).  Results  SNP array analysis  We performed genome-wide SNP analysis on leukocyte DNA extracted from 58 MPD patients: aCML (n = 30), V617F JAK2 negative MF (n = 18), and JAK2 mutation negative PV/idiopathic erythrocytosis (n = 10). As comparators, we also analyzed cases of CML in transformation to blast crisis (n = 30, of which 20 were myeloid and 10 lymphoid) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; n = 20). We conservatively defined likely regions of aUPD as at least 20 Mb of absent or significantly reduced heterozygous SNP calls (ie, < 5% SNPs called as heterozygous) running to a telomere without change in copy number (Figure 1A). Such large regions are uncommon in healthy individuals.19 Strikingly, we found that aUPD was common in aCML with 10 (33%) of cases affected. In contrast, aUPD was only seen in a single case of MF and was not seen in other patient subgroups. In total, 7 different chromosomes were affected, with abnormalities at 7q and 11q each seen recurrently in 10% of aCML cases. The affected regions ranged in size from 29 Mb to a complete copy of chromosome 13 (Table 1).

(A) Array analysis of 2 control patients showing copy number (CN) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) outputs. The x-axis for the CN plots show (copy number)âˆ’2 as determined by CNAT, with values approaching or exceeding âˆ’1 indicating deletions and greater than +1 indicating amplifications. The x-axis for LOH shows log10 P values (ie, 20 indicates 10âˆ’20). The 2 panels on the left are from a polycythemia vera (PV) case with a homozygous V617F JAK2 mutation. There is no gross copy number change (individual datapoints spread around the zero line), but a large block of homozygous SNP calls at 9p indicative of aUPD. The 2 panels on the right are from a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast crisis case and show LOH accompanied by a 20q deletion. (B) For case UPN 5, a large block of 11q aUPD is apparent on analysis of granulocytes but almost completely absent from mononuclear cells (MNCs) extracted from the same sample. (C) Chromosome 1p aUPD in case UPN 27 is associated with a biallelic G>T MPL mutation that is predicted to result in a W515L substitution. (D) Whole chromosome 13 isodisomy in case UPN 28 associated with a homozygous FLT3 ITD. Two controls are shown: an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient previously known to have a heterozygous FLT3 ITD and a healthy individual. View inlineView popup Table 1 Chromosomal regions and cases affected by aUPD Association between aUPD and known acquired oncogenic mutations  Although we did not have constitutional DNA to formally confirm that the regions of homozygosity were acquired, in 1 individual we found a marked reduction in the proportion of 11q aUPD positive cells on comparison of mononuclear cells and granulocytes, consistent with an acquired abnormality (Figure 1B). Some of the affected regions harbor genes known to be relevant to hematologic malignancies and therefore we assessed their mutational status. Sequencing of the MPL gene in the case UPN 27 with 1p aUPD revealed a homozygous G>T change (Figure 1C) that results in the previously reported W515L substitution.9 Case UPN 28 with whole chromosome 13 UPD had a homozygous FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD; Figure 1D). Candidate genes for the abnormalities at 17q and 21q include NF1 and RUNX1, respectively; however, these were not investigated.  11q aUPD is associated with CBL mutations  Next, we focused our analysis on the 2 recurrent regions of aUPD at 7q and 11q. Because of the strong association between MPNs and aberrant tyrosine kinase signaling, we analyzed genes encoding tyrosine kinases and associated signaling components. The minimally affected region at chromosome 7q contains 3 tyrosine kinases: MET, EPHA1, and EPHB6. We fully sequenced the coding exons of these genes in the 3 cases with 7q aUPD and 2 normal controls but found no abnormalities. Similarly, we found no sequence changes in exons 11 through 17 of BRAF, a gene encoding a downstream component of RAS signaling that is mutated in malignant melanoma and other cancers.20 There are no tyrosine kinase genes on chromosome 11q, and although there are several genes encoding signal transduction components, CBL stood out as a known oncogene that negatively regulates tyrosine kinase signaling.21 Sequencing of CBL in the three 11q aUPD cases revealed that UPN 2 and UPN 5 each had a T>C change at nucleotide 1277 in exon 8 that predicts a L380P substitution. Case UPN 3 had a C>G missense change in exon 9 at nucleotide 1387 that predicts a P417A change (Figure 2). Consistent with the array results, the mutations in cases UPN 3 and UPN 5 were predominant with the residual wild-type alleles only weakly visible. For case UPN 2 both the mutation and level of aUPD was less prominent, presumably due to a greater background of normal cells.

(C) Sequence changes indicated by â†“ in each case compared with normal controls. UPN 2 and UPN 5 each have the c.1139T>C: L380P mutation whereas UPN 3 has c.1249C>G: P417A. Prevalence and nature of CBL mutations  To determine the prevalence of CBL mutations, we sequenced exons 8 and 9 (that encode amino acids 366 through 409 and 410 through 477, respectively) in an additional 574 MPN cases. A total of 27 sequence variants were identified in 26 patients, of whom 3 had MF, 10 had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), 12 had aCML and 1 had hypereosinophilic syndrome/chronic eosinophilic leukemia (HES/CEL; Tables 2 and 3). To ensure that we were not missing mutations elsewhere in the gene we analyzed all coding exons in 70 CBL mutation negative aCML or unclassified, CML-like MPN cases by high resolution melt (HRM) analysis but failed to detect any further sequence changes apart from known polymorphisms. Similarly, no mutations in CBLB exons 9 or 10 or CBLC exons 7 and 8 (the exons that correspond to CBL exons 8 and 9) were identified. The activity of BCR-ABL is known to increase during progression of CML from chronic phase to blast crisis22 and we speculated that abrogation of CBL activity might be at least partially responsible for this increase. HRM analysis of CBL exons 8 and 9 in blast crisis cases (n = 31), however, failed to reveal any mutations.  View inlineView popup Table 2 Cases analyzed for CBL mutations View inlineView popup Table 3 List of CBL sequence variants Of the 27 CBL variants, 21 (78%) were missense substitutions affecting 12 amino acids (15 different substitutions), 5 (19%) were candidate splicing abnormalities, and 1 (3%) produced a stop codon (Table 3). Most of the changes were novel, although 4 cases had R420Q as previously identified in a single case of AML.15 Apart from N454D, all residues affected by missense mutations were completely conserved in CBL orthologues as well as the 2 other human CBL family members (Figure 3). The mutation to a stop codon was found in a patient (UPN 9) who also had the Y371H variant; PCR across the affected regions and sequencing indicated that the 2 changes were on different alleles.

Residues affected by missense mutations found in this study are indicated by â–¼. CBL mutations are acquired and rarely seen in conjunction with other known mutations  For 2 cases (UPN 5 and UPN 14) we were able to compare the mutational status of leukocytes and T cells or buccal epithelia cells. In both cases the L380P mutation was only present in leukocytes and was therefore acquired (Figure 4A). A third case (UPN 15) originally presented with V617F JAK2 negative ET in 1989 but progressed to MF in 2004. Analysis of DNA extracted from sequential bone marrow slides indicated that the R420Q mutation was absent at the ET phase but acquired on transformation (Figure 4B). The 3 CBL-positive MF cases tested negative for MPL 515 mutations and all CBL mutation positive cases were negative for cytogenetic indicators of tyrosine kinase fusions, FLT3 ITD, activating NRAS mutations and V617F JAK2, with the exception of 1 case (UPN 14) with MF who tested positive for both L380P CBL and V617F JAK2. Analysis of retrospective bone marrow slides for this case indicated the presence of V617F JAK2 at low level initially but absence of L380P CBL. The CBL mutation was detectable 7 years later and completely displaced V617F after a further 3 years, corresponding with a significant rise is peripheral leukocyte counts (Figure 4C). A further case (UPN 21) presented with systemic mastocytosis before evolving to CBL mutation-positive CMML but retrospective samples were unavailable.

(C) Clinical course of case UPN 14, who presented with MF in 1998 but experienced elevated leukocyte counts in 2005, concomitant with the appearance of the CBL L380P mutation. The JAK2 V617F mutation, which had been present at low level since diagnosis, was still detectable when CBL L380P first appeared but was undetectable in the 2008 sample, when the CBL mutated clone predominated (* on sequence trace). (D) RT-PCR analysis. All cases and controls show the expected product from CBL exons 7-10. Cases UPN 18 and UPN 20 show smaller bands that result from complete deletion of exon 8. Splicing abnormalities  RNA was available for 3 of the 5 cases with potential splicing mutations. Patients UPN 18 and UPN 20 both exhibited double bands by RT-PCR, sequencing of which showed one to be the normal product and the smaller band to result from the complete deletion of exon 8 in each case (Figure 4D), similar to that described in the cell line MOLM-13.23 Patient UPN 19 showed a single band by RT-PCR that was entirely normal on sequence analysis indicating that the exon 8+4 C>T change does not alter splicing. It seems likely, therefore, that the variant identified in case UPN 6 is also of no consequence. The pathogenicity of the intronic variant seen in case UPN 13 remains unknown.  The association between CBL mutations and UPD  To examine the association between CBL mutations and aUPD in more detail we performed microsatellite analysis on all mutated cases using 9 polymorphic markers spanning chromosome 11q13-qter. Of the 26 cases, 11 displayed patterns that indicated significant tracts of homozygosity, including all 3 with 11q aUPD detected by SNP arrays. Case UPN 9 with 2 mutations was heterozygous for all markers. Of the 11 cases with biallelic CBL mutations as judged by sequence analysis, 5 showed complete homozygosity at all microsatellite loci tested and 6 had at least 4 consecutive homozygous calls encompassing the location of the CBL gene at 11q23.3 (Figure 5). We performed multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) analysis to determine whether the observed homozygosity was a consequence of a deletion but no copy number changes were detected (data not shown) and therefore it is likely that homozygosity arose by aUPD. The number of mutated alleles estimated by sequencing was concordant with the microsatellite analysis in 20 cases (Figure 5). Of those that were discordant, UPN 6 and UPN 25 had significant tracts of 11q homozygosity but had a monoallelic CBL mutation whereas UPN 10 and UPN 16 did not show 11q homozygosity but had clear biallelic CBL mutations. The reason for these discrepant cases is unclear, but it is possible that the aUPD seen in UPN 6 and UPN 25 targeted another gene at 11q before acquisition of the CBL mutation. Homozygosity for the CBL mutations in the absence of 11q aUPD in UPN 10 and UPN 16 might be explained by a subcytogenetic deletion of 1 allele.  Figure 5 Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Figure 5 Microsatellite analysis of CBL mutation positive cases. The number of CBL mutated alleles (1 monoallelic; 2 biallelic) was estimated by sequence analysis as described in â€œExperimental procedures.â€� Microsatellites were scored as homozygous (Embedded Image) or heterozygous (â–¡) for each case and their positions on chromosome 11q are indicated. Correlation between CBL mutations and clinical features  We compared clinical and hematologic features in patients with or without CBL mutations, restricting the analysis to cases with aCML, MF and CMML because these were the subgroups in which CBL mutations were most commonly found. Patients with CBL mutations had a shorter overall survival and progression-free survival compared with mutation negative cases (overall survival: 33 months vs 39 months; progression-free survival: 22 months vs 32 months) but the differences were not significant (Figure 6). Similarly there was no significant difference in gender distribution, age and standard hematologic parameters between mutation positive and mutation negative cases and no differences emerged when individual disease entities were considered.

Overall survival (A) and progression-free survival (B) for atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and MF cases with (n = 19) or without (n = 87) CBL mutations. The differences between mutation positive and negative cases was not significant as determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Transforming activities of CBL mutants  We determined whether selected CBL variants had oncogenic activity by testing whether they could transform the interleukin-3 (IL-3)â€“dependent cell line 32D to growth factor independence in conjunction with overexpression of wild-type FLT3, as has been described previously for R420Q.15 We found that S376F, H398Y, P417A, and R420Q alone each conferred a degree of growth factor independence to 32D cells, but this effect was considerably enhanced in 32Ds that overexpressed wild-type FLT3. In contrast, wild-type CBL conferred no growth advantage either with or without FLT3 overexpression. The N454D change was not transforming, indicating that it is probably a rare polymorphism or a pathogenetically unimportant passenger mutation (Figure 7). Reproducible differences in survival between the different mutants were seen, as illustrated in Figure 8A.  Figure 7 Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Figure 7 Transforming activity of CBL mutants. 32D cells or 32Ds overexpressing wild-type FLT3 were transfected with wild-type or mutant CBL constructs and assayed for IL-3 independent growth over 3 days.

(A) Relative survival/proliferation of 32D cells expressing wild-type or mutant CBL constructs 48 hours after growth factor withdrawal as determined by MTS assay. (B) 32D cells expressing wild-type FLT3 and CBL constructs as indicated were transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin and stimulated with FLT3 ligand. After lysis, FLT3 was immunoprecipitated, blotted, and probed with anti-HA. Total blots for FLT3 AND CBL are also shown. Abrogation of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity  It has been shown that FLT3 physically associates with CBL and that, upon ligand stimulation, FLT3 is rapidly ubiquitinylated by wild-type but not R420Q CBL.15 We found that transforming activity correlated directly with the ubiquitin ligase activity of the CBL variants, as assayed by their ability to transfer HA-tagged ubiquitin to FLT3 after stimulation with FLT3 ligand. The S376F, H398Y, P417A and R420Q mutants showed loss of ubiquitin ligase activity, whereas N454D was comparable to wild-type CBL (Figure 8B).  Discussion  The initial aim of our study was to identify large regions of aUPD and therefore we undertook a relatively low resolution genome scan using 50k SNP arrays. Because we did not have constitutional DNA available from most of our cases, we were not able to unambiguously determine whether the extended blocks of homozygosity that we observed were a consequence of aUPD, constitutional UPD or autozygosity due to consaguinity, however we used a very conservative definition of candidate aUPD regions (at least 20 Mb homozygous SNPs calls running to a telomere) and therefore expected that most or all would be acquired. We found that aUPD was relatively common in aCML, but was uncommon in other MPNs that were negative for known mutations, plus also CML blast crisis and CLL. Six distinct regions of aUPD were identified in aCML, indicating substantial genetic heterogeneity in the genesis of this disorder. However, we identified 2 recurrent regions of aUPD at 7q and 11q that were each seen in 10% of cases indicating the presence of common molecular abnormalities.  Our mutation screening focused primarily on tyrosine kinases and associated signal transduction components because of the known association between deregulated tyrosine kinase signaling and MPNs.3 Although we failed thus far to identify any abnormality on chromosome 7q, we found missense CBL mutations in all three 11q aUPD cases. Screening of further MPNs revealed a total of 27 CBL variants in 26 patients who had been diagnosed with aCML (n = 12; 8%), MF (n = 3, 6%), CMML (n = 10, 13%), or HES/CEL (n = 1, 1%); that is, morphologically and clinically related diseases that generally exhibit a poor prognosis. We were unable to discern, however, any specific clinical or prognostic features specifically associated with CBL mutated cases.  Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (CBL) is a well characterized protein that plays both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling. In its positive role, CBL binds to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via its N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain and serves as an adaptor by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K. However the RING domain of CBL has E3 ligase activity and ubiquitinylates activated receptor tyrosine kinases on lysine residues, a signal that triggers internalization of the receptor/ligand complex and subsequent recycling or degradation.21,24,25 CBL was originally identified after the characterization of v-Cbl, the transforming component of the Cas NS-1 retrovirus, and thus its association with neoplasia is well established26; however, it is only very recently that CBL mutations were first identified in a human malignancy, specifically occasional cases of AML.15,23,27 We have found that CBL mutations are much more common in MPNs, and previous reports of 11q aUPD in MDS28 suggest that CBL mutations will also prove to be common in this disease. Indeed, 7 of 12 MDS cases with aUPD at 11q were recently shown to harbor CBL mutations.29 There are 2 other human CBL family members, CBLB and CBLC, but we did not identify aUPD in the regions containing these genes and did not detect any mutations of the linker/RING domain of CBLB.  We identified a total of 15 different CBL missense mutations affecting 12 residues (Table 2; Figure 3). Mutations of some of these residues (eg, Y371, C381, H398 and W408) have been analyzed previously in a study that concluded that loss of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and concomitant impairment of EGFR internalization by RING finger mutations was insufficient for oncogenicity, as assayed in NIH3T3 cells. However mutations of key residues within the Î±-helix of the linker region abolished ubiquitin ligase activity and were transforming.30 Although the precise amino acid substitutions we identified were different from those studied, we found that mutations in both the RING finger and linker regions conferred autonomous growth to 32D/wt-FLT3 cells, consistent with a causal relationship to the MPN phenotype. The fact that one mutation (N454D) was not transforming emphasizes the importance of functional analysis to distinguish driver mutations from irrelevant passengers or infrequent polymorphisms.31 Notably, this mutation was only weakly conserved between species, in contrast to all other missense mutations that affected highly conserved residues and are therefore likely to be functionally significant.  Enhanced autonomous growth in the presence of CBL mutations and overexpression of wild-type FLT3 may simply reflect the paucity of receptor tyrosine kinase gene expression in 32D cells or, alternatively, may indicate that the mutants are only weakly transforming and require the cooperation of other events to give rise to clinically manifest disease. Consistent with the latter hypothesis, we identified 2 cases in which CBL mutations were acquired during progression of a preexisting MPN (Figure 4). In both cases the identity of the cooperating change is unknown: although one presented with a (relatively low level) V617F JAK2 mutation, this disappeared on progression to CBL L380P positive disease, indicating that the 2 mutations must have arisen independently in different clones. This is reminiscent of the observation that the leukemic blasts of approximately half of V617F positive MPNs that evolve to AML are negative for the JAK2 mutation.32,33 It remains to be established, however, if CBL mutations are usually secondary events or whether the 2 cases we identified are exceptional.  Further evidence for the requirement for additional cooperating genetic events comes from published mouse studies in which neither complete CBL knockout nor heterozygous knockin of the RING finger inactivating mutant C379A (mouse C379 is equivalent to human C381) resulted in evidence of an MPN or other malignancy.34,35 However, closer analysis revealed subtle hemopoietic perturbations that clearly relate to the pathogenesis of MPNs. Specifically, hemopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from these animals were increased in number, hyperresponsive to thrombopoietin and more potent than wild-type HSCs in repopulating the hemopoietic system. These effects were associated with increased STAT5 accumulation and phosphorylation.34,35 Hyperresponsiveness to growth factors and stem cell involvement are 2 of the cardinal features of MPNs. Furthermore, the association between STAT5 activation and MPNs is well documented.36,37 While it is possible that overt hematologic disease might have been induced by a homozygous knockin mutant, these findings suggest that CBL mutations may not be solely responsible for a full MPN phenotype.  The nature of any cooperating abnormalities remains largely obscure. Our results show that overexpression of a tyrosine kinase can cooperate with CBL mutants to promote transformation, however we failed to identify any kinase that was consistently overexpressed in mutation positive cases by tyrosine kinase expression profiling (data not shown). One CBL mutation positive case, however, also tested positive for 7q UPD by SNP array, suggesting that these 2 abnormalities may complement each other. A CBL mutation resulting in skipping of exon 8 has also been identified in a murine model of NUP98-HOXD13 on progression from MDS to AML,38 further corroborating the theory that acute leukemia arises from complementary mutations, one of which inhibits differentiation, and a second (in this case CBL) that enhances proliferation or inhibits apoptosis.  The fact that many CBL mutations are associated with aUPD strongly suggests that clones with homozygous mutations have a selective advantage over those that are heterozygous. This contrasts with the prevailing view that transforming CBL RING finger and linker region mutants act in a dominant negative fashion. Although it is conceivable that another, unknown locus on 11q is the target of aUPD, the finding of 1 case with a Y371H mutation and a stop codon on opposite alleles strongly suggests that homozygous CBL mutations do indeed confer a direct selective advantage. Because we did not screen the entire gene for mutations, it is possible that other cases with heterozygous mutations may also be functionally homozygous due to premature stop codons on the other allele. Alternatively, heterozygosity in these cases may only be apparent due to variable proportions of background normal cells that are not part of the malignant clone. Although the nontransforming N454D mutant was heterozygous, 2 cases with heterozygous R420Q were observed and thus absence of homozygosity cannot be used to infer the presence of an irrelevant, nontransforming sequence variant.  In summary, we have found that oncogenic CBL mutations are acquired in a subset of hematologically related, poor prognosis MPNs. Our findings further strengthen the notion that MPNs are primarily â€œtyrosine kinopathies,â€� that is, diseases caused by aberrant activation of proliferation and survival pathways as a consequence of mutations that either directly or indirectly promote excess tyrosine kinase signaling. In view of the fact that tyrosine kinases are such good drug targets, the possibility that CBL-mutated cases might be amenable to therapeutic inhibition is clearly attractive.  \n",

monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors, but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study, we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability, binding, and activity. We found that recurrent, homozygous, and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2, by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and, to a lesser extent, with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding, whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity, and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL, driver mutations, protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations), the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability, interactions, and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures, their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2, 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity, stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5, 6). Strikingly, proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain (TKBD), a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain, while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time, since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain, they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9, 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK, CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein, thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study, substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach, which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability, binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely, we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent, homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.  Go to: Materials and Methods Computational modeling and analysis  Mapping of CBL mutations The COSMIC database (15) stores data on somatic cancer mutations and integrates the experimental data from full-genome sequencing studies. We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations), zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations), types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition, all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a â€œRandomâ€� missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures, we obtained 2,102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL), (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S), (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13), CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%, the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Ã…. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Ã… from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40,000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  Î”Gbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î”Gbindmut-Î”GbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î±Î”Î”Evdw+Î²Î”Î”Gsolv+Î³Î”SAmut+ÎµÎ”Î”GBM+Î»Î”Î”GFD+Î´ (3) Here Î”Î”Evdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and Î”Î”Gsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. Î”SAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. Î”Î”GBM and Î”Î”GFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX, respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation, optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( Î”Gfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( Î”GfoldWT).  Î”Î”Gfold=Î”Gfoldmut-Î”GfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27), the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). (See Supplementary Methods for more information.)  Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs, described above, were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T, the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega, Madison, WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15, A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15, and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp., Madison, WI), incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change, and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins, cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbeccoâ€™s PBS-containing 200 Î¼M sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals, Fairlawn, NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO], 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors [Complete tabsÂ®, Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16,000 Ã— g for 15 m at 4 Â°C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA). For immunoblotting, 20Î¼g of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue, 0.3573 M Î²-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations, 150 Î¼g of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer, then resuspended in 2X loading buffer, boiled for 5 m, then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman, Sanford, MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins, the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling), rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase, (clone 3F10; Roche), rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc., South Plainfield, NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc., Long Beach, CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination, in the presence of each CBL mutation, was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes, Î”Î”Gfold, upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35, 36). Namely, the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal molâˆ’1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations, recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value â‰ª 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1, Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall, the form of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the Î”Î”Gfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value â‰ª 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However, it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger, as we show later, this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (Î”Î”Gfold) and binding (Î”Î”Gbind) free energy changes for Single, Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V, G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements, whereas other mutations (S376F, Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example, L405P located in the middle of an Î±-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations, especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters, compared to random mutations (p-value â‰ª 0.01, Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations, therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value â‰ª 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state, consistent with experiments, we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability, recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B, S1 and Table S2). Importantly, cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next, all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations, Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them, several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example, the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal molâˆ’1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10, 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family, it strongly interacts with the Q92, W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q, R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation, there are 49 heterozygous (â€œHeteroâ€�) and 27 homozygous (â€œHomoâ€�) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall, we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 â€“ 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 â€“ 0.003) (Fig. 2B, Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6, 38, 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL, then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele, it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed, human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status, trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples, and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods, Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A, in the presence of wild-type CBL, activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type, CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells, predicted changes in stability (Î”Î”Gfold kcal molâˆ’1), binding affinity (Î”Î”Gbind kcal molâˆ’1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging, attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R, H398Q, Y371H, K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R, H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand, the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This, in turn, could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover, K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B,C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally, the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V, V430M, P428L, Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this, the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific, we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells, transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this, the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells, the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example, the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models, whereas V430M, consistent with experimental data, had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally, the third group constituted mutations (L399V, G375P, P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this, there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly, mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast, the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and Î”Î”Gfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed, the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of Î”Î”Gfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5, changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison, several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy, they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52, with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 (A) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (exponential model) and maximal predicted changes in stability. (B) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (linear model) and predicted changes in binding affinity of pCBL-E2-S state. ... There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations, (30â€“33, 41) and some of them use structural features (31, 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However, all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5, all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEANâ€™s score (R=0.58, Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural, foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand, thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites, which might not be energetically optimal (36, 42). In tumorigenesis, protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level, but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43, 44). However, the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein, here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies, which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation, we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity), while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study, about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity, while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models, we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However, these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed, many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations, but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly, the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene, their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47), where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48, 49). Importantly, all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact, the correlation between Î”Î”Gfold and Î”Î”Gbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 â€“ 0.48 depending on the CBL state, p-value < 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants, one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However, as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes, this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall, our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity, of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases, of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However, there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1), CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand, as shown in our study and in other studies, cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL, so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies, understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed, targeted therapies. Our approach, which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest, emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.  \n",



                                                                                                                                                                          Oncogenic mutations in the monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors, but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study, we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability, binding, and activity. We found that recurrent, homozygous, and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2, by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and, to a lesser extent, with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding, whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity, and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL, driver mutations, protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations), the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability, interactions, and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures, their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2, 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity, stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5, 6). Strikingly, proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain (TKBD), a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain, while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time, since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain, they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9, 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK, CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein, thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study, substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach, which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability, binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely, we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent, homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.  Go to: Materials and Methods Computational modeling and analysis  Mapping of CBL mutations The COSMIC database (15) stores data on somatic cancer mutations and integrates the experimental data from full-genome sequencing studies. We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations), zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations), types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition, all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a â€œRandomâ€� missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures, we obtained 2,102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL), (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S), (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13), CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%, the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Ã…. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Ã… from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40,000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  Î”Gbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î”Gbindmut-Î”GbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î±Î”Î”Evdw+Î²Î”Î”Gsolv+Î³Î”SAmut+ÎµÎ”Î”GBM+Î»Î”Î”GFD+Î´ (3) Here Î”Î”Evdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and Î”Î”Gsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. Î”SAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. Î”Î”GBM and Î”Î”GFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX, respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation, optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( Î”Gfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( Î”GfoldWT).  Î”Î”Gfold=Î”Gfoldmut-Î”GfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27), the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33).

Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs, described above, were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T, the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega, Madison, WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15, A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15, and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp., Madison, WI), incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change, and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins, cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbeccoâ€™s PBS-containing 200 Î¼M sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals, Fairlawn, NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO], 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors [Complete tabsÂ®, Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16,000 Ã— g for 15 m at 4 Â°C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA). For immunoblotting, 20Î¼g of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue, 0.3573 M Î²-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations, 150 Î¼g of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer, then resuspended in 2X loading buffer, boiled for 5 m, then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman, Sanford, MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins, the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling), rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase, (clone 3F10; Roche), rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc., South Plainfield, NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc., Long Beach, CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination, in the presence of each CBL mutation, was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes, Î”Î”Gfold, upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35, 36). Namely, the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal molâˆ’1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations, recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value â‰ª 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1, Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall, the form of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the Î”Î”Gfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value â‰ª 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However, it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger, as we show later, this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (Î”Î”Gfold) and binding (Î”Î”Gbind) free energy changes for Single, Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V, G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements, whereas other mutations (S376F, Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example, L405P located in the middle of an Î±-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations, especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters, compared to random mutations (p-value â‰ª 0.01, Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations, therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value â‰ª 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state, consistent with experiments, we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability, recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B, S1 and Table S2). Importantly, cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next, all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations, Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them, several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example, the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal molâˆ’1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10, 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family, it strongly interacts with the Q92, W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q, R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation, there are 49 heterozygous (â€œHeteroâ€�) and 27 homozygous (â€œHomoâ€�) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall, we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 â€“ 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 â€“ 0.003) (Fig. 2B, Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6, 38, 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL, then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele, it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed, human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status, trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples, and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods, Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A, in the presence of wild-type CBL, activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type, CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells, predicted changes in stability (Î”Î”Gfold kcal molâˆ’1), binding affinity (Î”Î”Gbind kcal molâˆ’1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging, attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R, H398Q, Y371H, K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R, H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand, the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This, in turn, could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover, K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B,C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally, the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V, V430M, P428L, Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this, the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific, we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells, transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this, the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells, the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example, the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models, whereas V430M, consistent with experimental data, had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally, the third group constituted mutations (L399V, G375P, P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this, there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly, mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast, the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and Î”Î”Gfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed, the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of Î”Î”Gfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5, changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison, several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy, they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52, with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 (A) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (exponential model) and maximal predicted changes in stability. (B) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (linear model) and predicted changes in binding affinity of pCBL-E2-S state. ... There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations, (30â€“33, 41) and some of them use structural features (31, 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However, all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5, all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEANâ€™s score (R=0.58, Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural, foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand, thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites, which might not be energetically optimal (36, 42). In tumorigenesis, protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level, but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43, 44). However, the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein, here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies, which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation, we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity), while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study, about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity, while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models, we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However, these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed, many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations, but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly, the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene, their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47), where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48, 49). Importantly, all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact, the correlation between Î”Î”Gfold and Î”Î”Gbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 â€“ 0.48 depending on the CBL state, p-value < 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants, one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However, as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes, this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall, our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity, of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases, of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However, there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1), CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand, as shown in our study and in other studies, cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL, so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies, understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed, targeted therapies. Our approach, which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest, emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.  \n",



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Oncogenic mutations in the monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors, but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study, we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability, binding, and activity. We found that recurrent, homozygous, and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2, by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and, to a lesser extent, with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding, whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity, and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL, driver mutations, protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations), the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability, interactions, and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures, their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2, 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity, stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5, 6). Strikingly, proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain (TKBD), a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain, while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time, since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain, they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9, 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK, CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein, thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study, substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach, which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability, binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely, we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent, homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.  Go to: Materials and Methods Computational modeling and analysis  Mapping of CBL mutations The COSMIC database (15) stores data on somatic cancer mutations and integrates the experimental data from full-genome sequencing studies. We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations), zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations), types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition, all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a â€œRandomâ€� missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures, we obtained 2,102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL), (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S), (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13), CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%, the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Ã…. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Ã… from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40,000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  Î”Gbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î”Gbindmut-Î”GbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î±Î”Î”Evdw+Î²Î”Î”Gsolv+Î³Î”SAmut+ÎµÎ”Î”GBM+Î»Î”Î”GFD+Î´ (3) Here Î”Î”Evdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and Î”Î”Gsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. Î”SAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. Î”Î”GBM and Î”Î”GFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX, respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation, optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( Î”Gfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( Î”GfoldWT).  Î”Î”Gfold=Î”Gfoldmut-Î”GfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27), the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). (See Supplementary Methods for more information.)  Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs, described above, were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T, the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega, Madison, WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15, A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15, and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp., Madison, WI), incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change, and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins, cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbeccoâ€™s PBS-containing 200 Î¼M sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals, Fairlawn, NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO], 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors [Complete tabsÂ®, Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16,000 Ã— g for 15 m at 4 Â°C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA). For immunoblotting, 20Î¼g of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue, 0.3573 M Î²-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations, 150 Î¼g of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer, then resuspended in 2X loading buffer, boiled for 5 m, then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman, Sanford, MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins, the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling), rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase, (clone 3F10; Roche), rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc., South Plainfield, NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc., Long Beach, CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination, in the presence of each CBL mutation, was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes, Î”Î”Gfold, upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35, 36). Namely, the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal molâˆ’1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations, recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value â‰ª 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1, Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall, the form of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the Î”Î”Gfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value â‰ª 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However, it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger, as we show later, this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (Î”Î”Gfold) and binding (Î”Î”Gbind) free energy changes for Single, Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V, G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements, whereas other mutations (S376F, Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example, L405P located in the middle of an Î±-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations, especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters, compared to random mutations (p-value â‰ª 0.01, Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations, therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value â‰ª 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state, consistent with experiments, we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability, recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B, S1 and Table S2). Importantly, cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next, all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations, Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them, several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example, the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal molâˆ’1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10, 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family, it strongly interacts with the Q92, W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q, R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation, there are 49 heterozygous (â€œHeteroâ€�) and 27 homozygous (â€œHomoâ€�) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall, we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 â€“ 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 â€“ 0.003) (Fig. 2B, Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6, 38, 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL, then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele, it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed, human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status, trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples, and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods, Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A, in the presence of wild-type CBL, activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type, CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells, predicted changes in stability (Î”Î”Gfold kcal molâˆ’1), binding affinity (Î”Î”Gbind kcal molâˆ’1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging, attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R, H398Q, Y371H, K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R, H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand, the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This, in turn, could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover, K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B,C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally, the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V, V430M, P428L, Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this, the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific, we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells, transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this, the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells, the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example, the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models, whereas V430M, consistent with experimental data, had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally, the third group constituted mutations (L399V, G375P, P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this, there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly, mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast, the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and Î”Î”Gfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed, the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of Î”Î”Gfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5, changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison, several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy, they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52, with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 (A) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (exponential model) and maximal predicted changes in stability. (B) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (linear model) and predicted changes in binding affinity of pCBL-E2-S state. ... There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations, (30â€“33, 41) and some of them use structural features (31, 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However, all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5, all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEANâ€™s score (R=0.58, Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural, foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand, thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites, which might not be energetically optimal (36, 42). In tumorigenesis, protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level, but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43, 44). However, the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein, here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies, which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation, we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity), while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study, about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity, while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models, we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However, these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed, many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations, but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly, the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene, their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47), where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48, 49). Importantly, all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact, the correlation between Î”Î”Gfold and Î”Î”Gbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 â€“ 0.48 depending on the CBL state, p-value < 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants, one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However, as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes, this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall, our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity, of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases, of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However, there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1), CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand, as shown in our study and in other studies, cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL, so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies, understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed, targeted therapies. Our approach, which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest, emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.  \n",
       "7  CBL is a negative regulator of activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). In this study, we determined the frequency of CBL mutations in acute leukemias and evaluated the oncogenic potential of mutant CBL. Experimental Design: The cDNA of 300 acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients and 82 human leukemic cell lines was screened for aberrations in the linker and RING finger domain of CBL. The oncogenic potential of identified mutants was evaluated in hematopoietic cells. Results:We identified 3 of 279 AML/MDS patients expressingCBL exon 8/9 deletion mutants. Three of four cases at diagnosis expressed deleted transcripts missing exon 8 or exon 8/9. In remission samples a weak or no expression of mutant CBL was detected. No aberrations were found in normal hematopoietic tissues. One of 116 sequenced AML/MDS cases carried a R420G missense mutation. All AML/MDS patients with identified CBL mutants belonged to the core bindingfactor and 11q deletion AML subtypes. Functionally, CBL negatively regulated FMSlike tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) activity and interacted with human FLT3 via the autophosphorylation sitesY589 andY599 and colocalized in vivo. Expression of CBLDexon8 and CBLDexon8+9 in FLT3-WT-Ba/F3 cells induced growth factor ^ independent proliferation associated with autophosphorylation of FLT3 and activated the downstream targets signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) and protein kinase B (AKT). FLT3 ligand ^ dependent hyperproliferation of CBL mutant cells could be abrogated by treatment with the FLT3 PTK inhibitor PKC412 (midostaurin). Conclusion: CBL exon8/9 mutants occur in genetically defined AML/MDS subtypes and transform hematopoietic cells by constitutively activatingthe FLT3 pathway. This phenotype resembles the one of mutated RTKs and suggests that CBL mutant AML patients might benefit from treatment with FLT3 PTK inhibitors. CBL, a known negative regulator of activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), is localized on human chromosome 11q23, a region frequently associated with chromosomal aberrations. Translocations t(4;11) and t(11;14), and mixed-lineage leukemia fusion genes involving CBL have been described in patients with leukemia and lymphoma (1â€“3). CBL oncogenes were initially identified in the murine system. CBL-70Z, carrying an internal deletion of 17 amino acids, was isolated from the 70Z/ 3 mouse pre-B-cell lymphoma cell line (4). CBL-70Z deregulates the cellular tyrosine kinase machinery, as NIH3T3 serumstarved cells expressing CBL-70Z showed significantly increased endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase activity after EGF stimulation (5). p95CBL, expressed in the murine reticulum sarcoma cell line J-774, lacks internal 111 amino acids, comprising whole exons 8 and 9 (6). CBL70Z and p95CBL mutations both target the linker and RING finger domain, which points to a mutation-sensitive region within the CBL protein. Recently the first human CBL mutation has been reported in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; ref. 7).

Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer in the RING finger domain (8, 9) and was shown to inhibit FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitylation (7). Additional screenings of AML patients revealed more cases with CBL mutations, including internal deletions of exon 8 and point mutations targeting G375 (10, 11). Activating FLT3 mutations represent one of the most common genetic alterations in AML and are associated with a poor prognosis (12). Overexpression of wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-WT) has been shown to synergize with other oncogenic fusions to induce aggressive AML in mice (13). Because of these reasons, FLT3 is a prominent target for therapeutic intervention. Currently two compounds targeting FLT3 kinase activity, PKC412 (midostaurin) and CEP701(lestaurtinib), have reached clinical phase III (14). As patients that do not carry activating FLT3 mutations benefit from treatment with FLT3 inhibitors (15), we hypothesized that other mechanisms, such as CBL mutations, might contribute to the oncogenic potential of FLT3. Here, we report a frequency of 1.1% of CBL exon8/9 mutations in AML/ myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Three of the four newly diagnosed AML/MDS patients expressed CBL lacking exon 8 or exon 8/9 and one patient carried a R420G missense mutation. Aberrant CBL transcripts were lost in remission samples. CBL is part of the human FLT3 downstream signaling pathway and promoted down-regulation of FLT3 activity. Finally, CBL deletion mutants CBLDExon8 and CBL exon8/9 transformed Ba/F3 cells in the presence, but not in the absence of FLT3-WT. Materials and Methods Analysis of cell lines and patient samples. The study design adhered to the principles of the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the ethics committees of participating institutions.

Each proliferation experiment was carried out at least three times independently. TaqMan PCR analysis. Quantification of CBL expression in Ba/F3 cells was analyzed by real-time quantitative-PCR with primers from Applied Biosystems as described previously (18). Translational Relevance In this article we provide detailed insight into the role of oncogenic CBL exon8/9 mutations in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but we could not find CBL mutations in our acute lymphoblastic leukemia cohort. Analysis of a large cohort of AML/MDS patients of different cytogenetic subgroups revealed an overall low frequency of CBL exon 8+9 deletions of 1.1%. However, we identified preferential association of CBL exon8/9 mutations with core bindingfactor leukemias and 11q aberrations. We describe that all known human CBL deletion mutants lead to transformation of wild-type FLT3 ^ expressing hematopoietic cells. This phenotype resembles that seen with activated receptor tyrosine kinases. Therefore, it is of particular note that analysis of CBL should be introduced in routine leukemia diagnostics, as patients who harbor CBL mutations might benefit from treatment with FLT3 protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Following extensive washing with PBS, Alexa 555 and Alexa 488 conjugated secondary antibodies were added for 1h. After further washing steps, the cells were stained with 4â€™,6-diamidino-2- phenylindole and mounted using Cytomat medium (DAKO). Finally, immunostained species were analyzed in a confocal fluorescence laser scanning system (TCS-SP2 scanning system and DM IRB inverted microscope; Leica). FLT3 receptor internalization. 3   105 cells were stimulated with 100ng/100 AL FLT3 ligand in PBS with 5% fetal bovine serum for indicated time periods. The reaction was stopped by adding 1mL 0.1% sodium azide in PBS on ice. After extensive washing the cells were stained with CD135-phycoerythrin antibody for fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. All conducted experiments were verified by replication. Results A subset of AML/MDS patients carries mutations in the protooncogene CBL. Recent reports have indicated a putative contribution of CBL mutations to the pathogenesis of human leukemias (7, 10). To obtain a comprehensive insight into the role of CBL in human acute leukemias, we firstly did a PCR screening of the cDNA of 61AML and 21acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines (Table 1; Supplementary Table S1) for deletions in the linker and RING finger domains. We identified a monoallelic CBL deletion transcript in the AML cell line MOLM-13 and the sister cell line MOLM-14. Sequencing of the aberrant transcripts revealed loss of the complete coding sequence of exon 8. All other analyzed cell lines expressed exclusively wild-type CBL (CBL-WT). Secondly, we used the above PCR screening assay to analyze a well-characterized cohort of AML/MDS and ALL patient samples for the presence of aberrant CBL transcripts (Table 1A). Among 279 AML samples of different cytogenetic subtypes and 21T-cell ALL samples we detected three AML/MDS patients expressing CBLWT as well as an aberrant CBL transcript (Table 1B). Patient 1 with a t(8;21) (AML1/ETO positive) and patient 2 with an 11q deletion both expressed a CBL transcript lacking exon 8, and patient 3 with an inv(16) (CBFB/MYH11 positive) expressed CBL lacking exon 8 and 9 (Table 1B; Fig. 1A). By PCR fragment analysis we determined the relative expression of mutant versus CBL-WT. For patient 1we detected 40% mutant versus 60% wild-type transcript. For patient 2 a 20% mutant versus 80% wild-type transcript was observed, supposedly due to the low blast count (20%) in the patient sample. Patient 3 showed equal ratios of mutant versus wild-type transcripts (data not shown). To verify that the shorter CBL transcripts were expressed in the malignant cell population, we analyzed remission samples in the case of patients 1and 3. Conventional PCR screening of remission samples from patient 1showed a weak expression of the transcript lacking exon 8 (Fig. 1B). PCR fragment analysis revealed that still 15% to 20% of the mutant CBL was present in the remission sample (data not shown). In case of patient 3 the PCR screening as well as the fragment analysis showed loss of the mutant CBL transcript lacking exon 8 and 9 in remission. To exclude the possibility of normally occurring splice variants, we analyzed the cDNA of normal human hematopoietic tissues, in detail normal bone marrow, peripheral leukocytes, spleen, and thymus. All of the analyzed tissues expressed exclusively CBL-WT transcripts (data not shown). In addition to the PCR screening, a subset of 116 PCR products from AML/MDS patients of all subtypes were analyzed by nucleotide sequencing comprising the region of exon 7, 8 and 9. One AML/MDS patient with an 11q aberration showed a substitution of arginine to glycine at position 420, which is located in the RING finger domain (Table 1B, Fig. 1A). In summary, we identified 2 of 61AML cell lines [3.3% (0.4%, 11.3%)] and 3 of 279 (1.1%) AML/MDS patients expressing aberrant CBL transcripts deleted in the linker and RING finger domains of CBL. Aberrant CBL transcripts could not be detected in any of the analyzed ALL cell lines and ALL patient samples. A murine CBL deletion transcript has been described in the 70Z/3 B-cell lymphoma cell line (CBL-70Z lacking the first 17 amino acids of exon 8; ref. 4). In the 70Z/3 line the causative event is a splice site mutation, changing the splice acceptor site AG to CG, generating an alternative splice site, which excludes the first 17 amino acids of exon 8 (Fig. 1A). Analysis of the genomic DNA of MOLM-13 cells detected a deletion of 14 nucleotides at the exon 8/intron 8 boundary eliminating a Table 1. A.

Two patients belong to CBF leukemias [t(8;21); inv(16)] and two patients harbor 11q aberrations. *A detailed listing of all cell lines is given in Supplementary Table 1.

Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer splicing element leading to expression of the CBLDexon8 mutant (data not shown), as had been described previously (10). By amplifying a 8,050-bp fragment of genomic DNA spanning intron 6 to exon 11 and subsequent nucleotide sequencing, we detected mutations in all three patients expressing aberrant CBL transcripts (data not shown). One allele of patient 1(CBLDexon8) harbored a deletion of 43 nucleotides at the exon 8-intron 8 boundary, including the last 36 nucleotides of exon 8 and the first 7 nucleotides of intron 8, thereby losing the whole splice donor site of intron 8. Analysis of the genomic DNA of patient 2 (CBLDexon8) revealed a point mutation of the splice donor site of intron 8, changing the conserved â€˜â€˜GTâ€™â€™ to â€˜â€˜GCâ€™â€™ in about 10% of the amplified DNA. The sample from patient 2 contained only 20% blasts, suggesting that this mutation occurred in one of the CBL alleles of the malignant clone. Patient 3 (CBLDexon8+9) carries a monoallelic large genomic deletion of 1,680 nucleotides, starting in intron 7 and ending in intron 9 leading to the loss of exon 8 and 9. In conclusion, all CBL transcripts, which lack whole exons, can be explained by genomic events that target splice donor or acceptor sites by mutations or deletions. CBL interacts with the FLT3 receptor and contributes to FLT3 downstream signaling. As CBL is known to be involved in the signal transduction of class III RTKs, platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA), FMS (colony forming growth factor 1 receptor), and KIT (stem cell factor receptor) (19â€“ 21), we hypothesized that CBL mutants might play a role in human FLT3 downstream signaling. Lysates of FLT3-WT expressing Ba/ F3 cells with or without FLT3 ligand stimulation were analyzed for the phosphorylation status of endogenous CBL. We could show that activation of human FLT3 after binding of FLT3 ligand leads to high levels of phosphorylated CBL in FLT3-WTâ€“ expressing cells, whereas the kinase-dead mutant receptor (FLT3-R644K) cells do not show phosphorylated CBL (Fig. 2A). To localize the interaction site within the FLT3-WT receptor we substituted two essential in vivo autophosphorylation sites of FLT3, tyrosines Y589 and Y599 (22), with phenylalanine. FLT3Y589F and FLT3Y599F receptorâ€“expressing cells show a remarkable decrease of CBL phosphorylation after FLT3 ligand stimulation compared with FLT3-WT â€“ expressing cells (Fig. 2A). We conclude that Y589 and Y599 participate in the interaction of the FLT3 receptor with CBL. To detect interaction of FLT3 and CBL, we did coimmunoprecipitation experiments with lysates from FLT3 ligand â€“ stimulated cells expressing V5-tagged FLT3-WT alone or together with CBLWT or CBL-70Z. Figure 2B shows that CBL-WT and CBL-70Z, interact with the FLT3 receptor. The FLT3 receptor is generally detected as two distinct bands, the mature glycosylated form at 155 kDa and the immature cytoplasmic form at 130 kDa (23). The interaction between CBL-WT and CBL-70Z with FLT3 occurred predominantly with the mature form of FLT3 (higher band). To study the interaction between the FLT3 receptor and CBL at the cellular level, we did in vivo colocalization experiments using immunofluorescence of FLT3 and CBL-WT. In U2OS human osteosarcoma cells transiently transfected FLT3 localizes to the cell membrane and the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C). In the cytoplasm FLT3 accumulates in the perinuclear endoplasmatic reticulum, consistent with recent reports (24). CBL shows a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution. Stimulation of the cells with FLT3 ligand results in internalization of FLT3, which is indicated by loss of FLT3 staining in the cell membrane and formation of endosomal vesicles. Upon addition of FLT3 ligand, CBL clearly colocalizes with internalized FLT3 in the endosomal vesicles. CBL regulates the function of EGFR via ubiquitin-dependent degradation of EGFR (25, 26). Therefore, we sought to investigate if CBL negatively regulates human FLT3. Two hundred and ninety-three cells were transiently transfected with FLT3-WT alone or FLT3-WT and CBL-WT and stimulated with FLT3 ligand for different time periods. Lysates were analyzed for FLT3 phosphorylation and total levels of FLT3 protein. Figure 2D shows constant phosphorylation and levels of FLT3 protein in FLT3-WTâ€“ transfected cells up to 120 minutes, Fig. 1. Identified CBL mutants in AML patients. Aberrant CBL transcripts are lost in remission.

Shown below are the CBL deletion mutants, CBLDexon8 and CBLDexon8+9, found in AML patients, CBL-70Z, a known oncogenic form of CBL, comprisinga deletion of the first 17 amino acids within exon 8, and the location of R420, found to be mutated in one AML patient in our study.

Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer whereas the phospho-tyrosine signal is comparably less in double-transfected cells after 60 minutes and barely detectable after 120 minutes. The total protein levels of FLT3 are significantly reduced after 90 minutes of FLT3 ligand stimulation in the double-transfected cells compared with FLT3-WT â€“ transfected cells, implicating an enhanced degradation of FLT3 by CBL. CBL mutants confer a transforming potential to Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-WT. In light of the direct interaction between FLT3 and CBL and the modulation of FLT3 signaling by CBL, we hypothesized that CBL mutants could activate the oncogenic potential of FLT3-WT in AML blasts. The following CBL mutants found in AML/MDS patients and leukemic cell lines, CBLDexon8, CBLDexon8+9 and CBLR420 and CBLG375 point mutants, as well as CBL-WT and CBL-70Z as a positive control, were generated and subcloned into MSCVGFP. FLT3-WT was subcloned into MSCV-YFP vector. All CBL constructs were stably expressed alone or together with FLT3- WT in Ba/F3 cells. Positive selection was done by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting. The expression of transduced human CBL in FLT3-WT/CBL coexpressing cells was higher than the expression of endogenous CBL, as analyzed by real time quantitative-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S1A) and verified by Western Blot analysis for the CBLDexon8+9 mutant (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Expression of any single CBL construct alone or coexpression of CBL-WT and FLT3-WT did not confer growth factor independent proliferation to Ba/F3 cells (data not shown). However, coexpression of CBL-70Z, CBLDexon8 or CBLDexon8+9 with FLT3-WT led to significant IL-3 independent proliferation (Fig. 3A). Compared with the CBL deletion mutants, expression of CBL R420G, R420Q, G375S, and G375P point mutants did not confer any proliferative capacity, but enhanced cell survival, as 50% of cells survived for 3 days after IL-3 withdrawal compared with 10% survival of the control cells (data not shown). The presence of FLT3 ligand induced a strong dosedependent proliferation of FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z, FLT3-WT/ CBLDexon8, and FLT3-WT/CBLDexon8+9 cotransduced cells Fig. 2. CBL is phosphorylated after activation of human FLT3-WT, directly interacts with FLT3 through tyrosines Y589 and Y599, and negatively regulates FLT3WT. A, unstimulated (-) or FLT3 ligand (FL) ^ stimulated (+; 5 min; 100 ng/mL) Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-WT, FLT3Y589F, FLT3Y599F, or FLT3K644R were lysed, and endogenous CBL protein was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal CBL antibody and analyzed for the tyrosine phosphorylation status by immunoblottingwith phospho-Tyrosine antibody. B, 293 cells were transfected with MIY (control),V5-tagged FLT3-WT CBL-WTorV5-tagged FLT3-WT CBL-70Z and stimulated with 100 ng/mL FLT3 ligand for 5 min. Coimmunoprecipitation of CBL and FLT3 was done with polyclonal CBL antibody. After separation on SDS-PAGE and blottingon nitrocellulose membrane, V5-tagged FLT3-WTwas detected with monoclonal V5 antibody. Control samples contained either no or unspecific IgG antibody.

FLT3 protein was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and blotted for phospho-tyrosine, stripped and reblotted for FLT3.

Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer with a proliferation rate about 4 to 6 times higher than the control cells (Fig. 3B). The FLT3-WT/CBLG375 cotransduced cells showed no increase in proliferation rate compared with FLT3-WT cells. The FLT3-WT/CBLR420Q mutant cells showed a 2-fold enhanced proliferation rate compared with FLT3-WT cells (data not shown). Incubation of the FLT3-WT/CBL mutant coexpressing cells with the FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 in increasing nontoxic concentrations up to 50 nmol/L or the FLT3 inhibitor SU5614 up to 5 Amol/L in the presence of 50 ng/mL FLT3 ligand led to a dose-dependent abrogation of the proliferation (Fig. 3C). Coexpression of a kinase-dead FLT3 receptor, FLT3K644R, with CBL-70Z provided further evidence that the FLT3 kinase activity is required for the transformed phenotype, as it did not lead to IL-3 â€“independent proliferation (data not shown). Collectively, the overexpression of CBL-70Z, CBLDexon8 or CBLDexon8+9 in FLT3-WT â€“expressing Ba/F3 cells led to factor independent growth and FLT3 ligandâ€“ dependent hyperproliferation. Coexpression of CBL deletion mutants with FLT3-WT autoactivates the FLT3 receptor. The known classes of FLT3 mutations have been shown to autoactivate the kinase activity of FLT3 (16, 27â€“ 30). We prepared lysates of FLT3 ligand â€“ stimulated and nonstimulated Ba/F3 cells coexpressing FLT3- WT and a CBL deletion mutant, immunoprecipitated the FLT3 receptor, and analyzed it for tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast to FLT3-WT- or FLT3-WT/CBL-WT â€“expressing cells, all three CBL mutantâ€“expressing cells displayed autophosphorylated FLT3 in the absence of FLT3 ligand (Fig. 4A). Stimulation with FLT3 ligand induced high phosphorylation levels of FLT3 Fig. 3. CBL deletion mutants induce a transformingpotential in FLT3-WT ^ expressingBa/F3 cells and respond to FLT3 PTK inhibitor treatment A, cells stably transduced with FLT3-WTalone or FLT3-WTand CBL-WT, CBL-70Z, CBLDexon8 or CBLDexon8+9 were cultured in the absence of IL3 for 72 h and viable cells counted after trypan blue exclusion. B, cells were analyzed accordingto A, but different concentrations of FL up to 100 ng/mL were added to the culture medium. C, cells were analyzed accordingto A, but 50 ng/mL FLT3 ligand and different concentrations of the FLT3 inhibitor PKC412 up to 50 nmol/L or SU5614 up to 5 Amol/L were added to the culture medium. Three independent experiments were done. CBL exon8/9 Mutants in AML/MDS Subtypes www.aacrjournals.org 2243 Clin Cancer Res 2009;15(7) April 1, 2009 Research. Downloaded from clincancerres.aacrjournals.org on May 27, 2017. Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer in all analyzed cells. The amount of phosphorylated FLT3 in FLT3-WT/CBL mutantâ€“expressing cells was considerably higher than in control cells, as was the amount of total FLT3 protein. This confirms the hypothesis that coexpression of a CBL deletion mutant, but not CBL-WT, leads to a remarkable stabilization of the FLT3 protein within the cells by inhibiting the down-regulation and degradation of the FLT3 protein. Analysis of the phosphorylation status of transduced CBL in FLT3-WT/CBL mutant â€“expressing cells revealed that all CBL mutants became phosphorylated after stimulation of the cells with FLT3 ligand (Fig. 4B). Of note, we detected a weak constitutive phosphorylation of CBL mutants, but not CBL-WT, in the absence of FL. Autoactivation of FLT3 results in ligand-independent signaling of the receptor (31, 32). We therefore analyzed the activation of three important downstream signaling effectors of FLT3: signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinases B (AKT), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Activated STAT5 and AKT were detected in unstimulated FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z-, Fig. 4. Coexpression of CBL deletion mutants autoactivates FLT3, CBL mutants, and the downstream signaling pathways STAT5 and AKTA, Mock, FLT3-WT, FLT3-WT/CBL-WT, FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z, FLT3-WT/CBLDexon8, and FLT3-WT/ CBLDexon8+9 cells were starved for 24 h in the presence of 0.3% FCS and unstimulated or stimulated with 100 ng/mL FLT3 ligand for 5 min. FLT3 was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal FLT3 antibody and analyzed by immunoblottingwith phospho-tyrosine antibody, stripped, and reprobed with FLT3 antibody. B, CBL-WTand CBL mutant proteins were immunoprecipitated with hemagglutinin- orV5-antibody and analyzed as described in A. C, cells were treated accordingtoA and crude cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed for phosphorylation of STAT5 and AKTusing phospho-specific antibodies. D, WST proliferation assays were done in presence of FLT3 ligand and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin.

Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer FLT3-WT/CBLDexon8-, and FLT3-WT/CBLDexon8+9 â€“ coexpressing cells but not FLT3-WT- or FLT3-WT/CBL-WT â€“ coexpressing cells (Fig. 4C). However, no differences were observed in MAPK activation, as all unstimulated cells lack phosphorylated MAPK (data not shown). To evaluate the contribution of the PI3K pathway to the FLT3 ligand â€“ dependent proliferation of FLT3-WT/CBL mutant â€“ expressing cells, we analyzed the proliferative capacity of FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z â€“ coexpressing cells and FLT3-WT/CBL-WT control cells in the presence of the small molecule inhibitors LY294002 and rapamycin. LY294002 is a well known PI3K inhibitor (33) and rapamycin specifically inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, a downstream target of PI3K (34, 35). Both compounds were able to significantly, but not totally, inhibit the proliferation of FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z cells (Fig. 4D). The IC50 value for FLT3- WT/CBL-70Z â€“expressing cells were 3.8 Amol/L for LY294002 and 0.5 nmol/L for rapamycin, pointing to a strong contribution of the PI3K/AKT pathway to the transforming phenotype of FLT3/CBL mutant â€“ coexpressing cells. Incubation of the cells with the maximum used concentration of inhibitor in presence of IL-3 was not cytotoxic (data not shown). Expression of CBL-70Z in FLT3-WT cells does not alter the internalization of the FLT3 receptor. Analysis of EGFR activity has shown that CBL promotes the invagination of the plasma membrane during receptor endocytosis (25, 26, 36). CBL-70Z has been proposed to act in a dominant negative manner preventing binding of CBL-WT to activated RTKs (37). We intended to analyze whether the expression of CBL-WT or CBL-70Z might alter the rate or timing of FLT3 internalization after activation with FLT3 ligand. We did staining of FLT3 or FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z â€“expressing cells with CD135 antibody to detect the levels of FLT3 on the surface dependent on the time of FLT3 ligand stimulation up to 60 minutes. In FLT3-WT cells the FLT3 receptor is rapidly internalized after 10 to 20 minutes of FLT3 ligand stimulation (Fig. 5). In contrast to FLT3-WT the kinase-dead FLT3K644R, which served as a control, was not internalized even after 60 minutes of FLT3 ligand stimulation. Coexpression of CBL-WT (data not shown) or the mutant CBL- 70Z had no effect on the receptor turnover as after 20 minutes of FLT3 ligand stimulation FLT3 was undetectable on the cell surface in all analyzed cells. Discussion Growth factors and their associated membrane bound receptors play an important role in the initiation and propagation of many types of cancer (38). As the aberrant activation of RTKs by overexpression and activating mutations is a well-investigated topic in oncology research, it is becoming increasingly clear that impaired receptor down-regulation might contribute to the malignant phenotype as well (39). Receptor down-regulation involves ligand-induced endocytosis and subsequent degradation of the proteins in the lysosomes, leading to termination of RTK signaling and, in case of disturbance, to aberrantly extended signaling. Recent findings have addressed the aberrant down-regulation of FLT3 by CBL in AML (7, 10, 11). In this study we provide a comprehensive insight by analyzing 300 AML/MDS and ALL cases. Four of 279 AML/MDS patients, but no ALL patients, were found positive for expression of aberrant CBL transcripts in the linker and RING finger domains, previously characterized as the critical location for transforming mutations. The equivalently analyzed large number of AML and ALL cell lines revealed two positive AML cell lines, MOLM-13 and the sister cell line MOLM-14, which matches the results obtained in patient material and points to a low frequency of CBL mutations in AML. However, an independent study found 1of 12 AML patients with a point mutation in CBL-b (10), a CBL family member, highlighting the importance of further studies to determine the contribution of CBL members to the pathogenesis of AML (10). Of more importance was whether other aberrations in other negative regulatory molecules, e.g. SHP phosphatases, lead to deregulated RTK activity. Three of the described aberrant CBL transcripts lack whole exons, which were significantly decreased in expression or not detectable in the patientâ€™s remission controls. Screening of Fig. 5. The internalization of FLT3-WT is not disturbed by coexpression of CBL70Z. Ba/F3 cells expressingFLT3-WT, FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z, or FLT3-KD were stimulated with FLT3 ligand for different time periods from 0 min up to 60 min. After stimulation cells were immediately incubated on ice and cell membranes fixed by addition of 0.3% sodium azide. Cells were stained with FLT3-specific surface antibody and analyzed in fluorescence-activated cell sorter for surface expression levels of FLT3.

Â© 2009 American Association for Cancer normal hematopoietic tissues did not show aberrant CBL transcripts, further pointing to an oncogenic event in the malignant clone. Indeed, all three patients carried genomic lesions affecting splice donor or acceptor sites by mutation or deletion, so that we can clearly exclude aberrant splicing events within the malignant clone. Of note, we detected a preferential association of CBL mutations with specific subtypes of AML/MDS. Among 43 cases of core binding factor leukemias [t(8;21) and inv(16)] two patients expressing aberrant CBL transcripts were identified [4.7% (0.6%, 15.8%)]. As core binding factor leukemias show a high expression of the RTK KIT (40), further studies need to address the question of whether CBL mutations might lead to autoactivation of KIT in these patients. Two of 13 patients with 11q deletions were found positive [15.4% (1.9%, 45.4%)]. This AML/MDS subgroup shows the highest FLT3 expression among all AML subgroups (41), so that CBL mutations might be the event causing the high FLT3 expression and an aberrant FLT3 activation in these patients. CBL was shown to be responsible for ubiquitination of several receptors including EGFR, PDGFRA, and FMS (25, 42, 43). Until now only indirect evidence existed for a role of CBL in human FLT3 downstream signaling. Lavagna-Sevenier et al. reported prominent CBL phosphorylation in human hematopoietic cell lines expressing endogenous FLT3 (44). Recently Sargin et al. reported the physical interaction of CBL with a murine chimeric FLT3 receptor, where the juxtamembrane domain has been replaced by human sequences (7). Their study presents further indirect evidence that CBL is the responsible E3 ligase ubiquitinating the chimeric murine FLT3 receptor after binding of FLT3 ligand. However, this remains to be tested for human FLT3. Here, we provide clear evidence that murine endogenous CBL is rapidly phosphorylated after activation of the human FLT3-WT receptor. As murine and human CBL share 92% homology, we conclude that this signaling event is conserved from mice to humans. Recently Heiss et al. identified two important in vivo autophosphorylation sites of human FLT3 after FLT3 ligand stimulation, tyrosines 589 and 599, which associate with important signaling molecules, like Src family members and SHP2 (22). Mutation of Y589 and Y599 to phenylalanine revealed a significantly decreased phosphorylation of CBL in response to FLT3 ligand stimulation of the mutant FLT3 receptors, implicating that these tyrosines serve as docking sites. A similar effect has been seen for the corresponding juxtamembrane tyrosines Y568 and Y570 in KIT and Y572 and Y574 in PDGFRa (21 , 45). However, as still small amounts of phosphorylated CBL were detectable, we propose that FLT3 contains more interaction sites for CBL, which might be direct or indirect via adaptor proteins, e.g. GRB2. Additional COOHterminal association sites of CBL have been described for FMS (Y973) and for KIT (Y936; refs. 19, 46). In coimmunoprecipitation experiments we have shown interaction of overexpressed human FLT3-WT with human CBL-WT after FLT3 ligand stimulation. The interaction of CBL-70Z with FLT3-WT was even more pronounced, indicating that the interaction of mutant CBL and FLT3 might be more stable and might be very efficient in blocking CBL-WT from binding sites on activated FLT3 receptors. In vivo colocalization experiments confirmed colocalization of FLT3 and CBL in endosomal vesicles after FLT3 ligand stimulation of cells. It has been suggested that CBL ubiquitylates FLT3 (7). Here, we show that the presence of overexpressed CBLWT enhances down-regulation of FLT3 after binding of FLT3 ligand, providing direct evidence for a functional role of CBL in down-regulation of FLT3 activity. To analyze the transforming potential of CBL mutants we have chosen the IL-3 â€“dependent cell line BaF3, as it is a valuable model for the investigation of activated RTKs. We analyzed all human CBL mutations thus far detected and CBL- 70Z as a control. Only cells coexpressing FLT3-WT and a CBL deletion mutant were able to proliferate in the absence of IL-3. CBL point mutants coexpressed with FLT3WT showed enhanced survival, but no proliferative capacity in BaF3 cells. This finding is in contrast to the recent study of Sargin et al., in which the R420Q point mutation induced IL-3 â€“independent growth in myeloid 32D cells (7). This discrepancy may arise from the different cell systems used and highlights the need to analyze the phenotype of CBL mutations in primary cells. The addition of exogenous FLT3 ligand induced a rapid proliferative response to FLT3-WT CBL deletion mutant â€“ coexpressing cells. As AML blasts coexpress FLT3 ligand leading to an autocrine stimulation, this phenotype mimics the in vivo situation (47, 48). In the case of CBL point mutants only R420Q, but not G375 mutants, show significant growth in vitro in presence of FLT3 ligand. Coexpression of a CBL mutant autophosphorylates FLT3 and downstream molecules STAT5 and AKT. Additionally, CBL mutants themselves are constitutively phosphorylated, which points to a so far undescribed mechanism independent from the proposed dominant negative mechanism, in which CBL mutants block CBL-WT from binding sites at activated RTKs (47). Consistent with a dominant negative behavior of CBL mutants is the fact that we detected higher levels of FLT3 protein in FLT3/CBL mutant cells compared with control cells, as the increased stability of the FLT3 protein should be the result of a decreased degradation of FLT3. Analyzing the internalization rate of FLT3 in FLT3-WT and FLT3-WT/CBL-70Z cells revealed no difference in rate and speed of internalization; thus, early steps of endocytosis of FLT3 seem not to be affected by the presence of a CBL deletion mutant. This is in concert with a study from Jiang et al., in which late stages of endocytosis, but not recruitment of EGFR into coated pits, were affected by CBL-70Z (48). However, Sargin et al. found a slightly reduced internalization of FLT3 in the presence of CBL-70Z and CBLR420Q, so that this information is in conflict and needs to be clarified. Taken together, aberrant CBL transcripts occur in AML and are associated with core binding factor leukemias and 11q aberrations. The CBL deletion mutants show a transforming phenotype in BaF3 cells in the presence of FLT3, that resembles the phenotype seen in FLT3-activating mutations (FLT3-ITD, FLT3-TKD, FLT3-JM-PM). This new mechanism of activation through mutated negative-regulatory molecules of RTKs opens a door for treating patients with PTK inhibitors, who do not carry mutations in the RTK itself.  Acquired somatic uniparental disomy (UPD) is commonly observed in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN), or secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (sAML) and may point toward genes harboring mutations. Recurrent UPD11q led to identification of homozygous mutations in c-Cbl, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in attenuation of proliferative signals transduced by activated receptor tyrosine kinases. We examined the role and frequency of Cbl gene family mutations in MPN and related conditions.  Methods  We applied high-density SNP-A karyotyping to identify loss of heterozygosity of 11q in 442 patients with MDS, MDS/MPN, MPN, sAML evolved from these conditions, and primary AML. We sequenced c-Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-c in patients with or without corresponding UPD or deletions and correlated mutational status with clinical features and outcomes.  Results  We identified c-Cbl mutations in 5% and 9% of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and sAML, and also in CML blast crisis and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). Most mutations were homozygous and affected c-Cbl; mutations in Cbl-b were also found in patients with similar clinical features. Patients with Cbl family mutations showed poor prognosis, with a median survival of 5 months. Pathomorphologic features included monocytosis, monocytoid blasts, aberrant expression of phosphoSTAT5, and c-kit overexpression. Serial studies showed acquisition of c-Cbl mutations during malignant evolution.  Conclusion  Mutations in the Cbl family RING finger domain or linker sequence constitute important pathogenic lesions associated with not only preleukemic CMML, JMML, and other MPN, but also progression to AML, suggesting that impairment of degradation of activated tyrosine kinases constitutes an important cancer mechanism.  Go to: INTRODUCTION Mutations and genomic aberrations constitute key pathogenic lesions in myeloid malignancies. In primary acute myelogenous leukemia (pAML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), reciprocal translocations have enhanced our understanding of molecular pathogenesis, improved diagnosis and provided rational therapeutic targets. In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN), and AML evolved from MDS or MDS/MPN (secondary AML [sAML]), unbalanced chromosomal lesions predominate and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is of particular importance. LOH can arise either via hemizygous deletion, where a DNA segment is lost from one homolog while the other remains at one copy per cell, or by uniparental disomy (UPD), wherein the retained homolog is duplicated to preserve two total copies per cell at the locus. Thus, analysis of recurrent regions of LOH may point toward the presence of important mutations. Mutations seen in MDS and AML affect specific classes of genes and indicate general pathways of leukemia evolution.1 For example, mutations have been found in a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases, including c-Kit, c-Mpl, and Flt-3.2â€“4 Mutations also affect signal transduction genes such as Jak2 and NPM-1. tP53 constitutes an example of a proapoptotic tumor suppressor gene mutated in aggressive leukemias.5â€“7  Until recently, metaphase cytogenetics was applied for detection of chromosomal defects including deletions resulting in LOH. Using this technique, a number of invariant chromosomal abnormalities have been described and minimal affected regions delineated, pointing towards potentially pathogenic genes. Single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) â€“based cytogenetic analysis allows for better resolution of chromosomal defects, with identification of previously cryptic unbalanced lesions.8 In particular, SNP-A is able to identify UPD. We and others have recently shown that somatic UPD affecting various chromosomes can be found frequently in MDS, MDS/MPN, and sAML and have identified a number of recurrent areas.9â€“11 Initially, UPD9p was shown to lead to homozygosity of the Jak2 V617F mutation in MPN.12â€“14 Using SNP-A, we have demonstrated that other areas of UPD can also be associated with homozygous mutations, including UPD13p (Flt-3 ITD) and UPD1p (c-Mpl).15,16 Based on this paradigm, we recently identified a novel recurrent area of UPD at 11q, frequently present in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and AML evolved from atypical MDS/MPN, and through delineation of a commonly deleted region have identified mutations in c-Cbl.15 c-Cbl is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in degradation of activated receptor tyrosine kinases and other tyrosine kinases, including Src kinases. Consequently, mutations affecting the RING finger domain (RFD) may have a wide range of effects on proliferation regulation, crucial to both MPN and AML. In animal studies, c-Cbl knockout led to hyper-responsiveness to ligand stimulation and expansion of them in cell pools, overall resulting in a mild proliferative phenotype.17 However, RFD mutation knock-in in a c-Cblâˆ’/âˆ’ mouse model resulted in a myeloproliferative phenotype and leukemic evolution (W.Y. Langdon, personal communication, December 2008). In a transgenic MDS NUP98/HOX13 mouse model, progression to sAML with acquisition of RAS and c-Cbl mutations occurs frequently.18  We hypothesized that mutations inactivating oncogene degradation pathways may constitute a new class of molecular lesions in myeloid malignancies modifying current paradigms of leukemogenesis. We therefore investigated the presence of mutations in the Cbl family of E3 ubiqutin ligases in selected subtypes of malignant myeloid disorders and determined the phenotypic and functional features as well as clinical outcomes. Based on the study of these features we set out to discern the pathophysiologic principles of molecular dysfunction created by E3 ubiquitin ligase lesions.  Go to: METHODS Patients  Bone marrow aspirates were collected from 442 patients with MDS (n = 115), MDS/MPN (n = 98), MPN (n = 22), sAML (n = 110) evolved from these conditions, and pAML (n = 97) seen at Cleveland Clinic and Johns Hopkins Hospital between 2003 and 2008 (Appendix Table A1, online only). Informed consent for sample collection was obtained according to protocols approved by institutional review boards. Diagnosis was confirmed at each primary institution and assigned according to WHO classification criteria.19  Single Nuclotide Polymorphism Array Analysis  High-density Affymetrix SNP-A (250K and 6.0 arrays; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) were applied as a karyotyping platform to identify LOH on chromosome 11q. Lesions identified by SNP-A were compared to the Database of Genomic Variants20 (http://projects.tcag.ca/variation/) and an internal control series (n = 1,003) to exclude known copy number variations. To confirm all regions of LOH detected by 250K SNP-A, we repeated samples when possible on 6.0 arrays and analyzed using Genotyping Console version 2.0 (Affymetrix). Signal intensity was analyzed and SNP calls determined using Gene Chip Genotyping Analysis Software version 4.0 (GTYPE, Affymetrix). Copy number and areas of UPD were investigated using a Hidden Markov Model and CN Analyzer for Affymetrix GeneChip Mapping 250K arrays (CNAG version 3.0) as previously described.21  E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Mutational Screening  To screen patients for mutations in c-Cbl, Cbl-b, Cbl-c, and Hakai, direct genomic sequencing of all exons was performed (details of primers and conditions are available on request). For sequencing, 250 ng of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product, 3 Î¼mol/L original forward or reverse primer, 2 Î¼L Big Dye version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and 14.5 Î¼L deionized H2O were amplified under the following conditions: 95Â°C (2 minutes) followed by 25 cycles of 95Â°C (10 seconds), 50Â°C (5 seconds), and 60Â°C (4 minutes). Sequencing was performed as previously described.15 If a mutation was intronic, RNA was extracted by TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction performed for confirmation of splice variants.  Immunohistochemical Detection of pSTAT5  Staining was performed on a Benchmark XT platform (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ), according to the manufacturer's instructions, using mouse monoclonal antiphospho-STAT5a/b (Y694/99; Advantex BioReagents LLP, Conroe, TX) at 1:500 dilution. All stains were scored without knowledge of the clinical diagnosis or mutational status. Phospho-STAT5-positive staining (nMEG pSTAT5) was defined as previously reported.22,23 Images were obtained via digital microscopy using an Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus America, Melville, NY) equipped with either a UPlanFl 40Ã—/0.75 numeric aperture (NA) or a UPlanFl 100 Ã—/1.30 NA objective. Images were captured using a Dage-MTI Model DC330E charge-coupled device camera (Dage-MTI, Michigan City, IN) attached to the microscope with a U-TV1X-2 video adapter (Olympus America) and a 0.45Ã— camera coupler (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI).  Statistical Analysis  Overall survival was defined as the time a patient was diagnosed with a myeloid malignancy at Cleveland Clinic or Johns Hopkins to death or last known contact, and analyzed using Kaplan-Meier statistics and Cox's proportional hazards model. For comparison of the frequency of clinical features between Cbl family mutation and wild-type (WT), categoric variables were analyzed using Fisher's exact test.  Go to: RESULTS Detection of UPD11q Using SNP-A and Detection of c-Cbl Mutation  Previously, we identified homozygous c-Cbl mutations in patients with CMML and UPD11q.15 Using SNP-A karyotyping, we studied a large cohort of patients (n = 442) with MDS and related disorders, including JMML and CML blast crisis (CML-BC), to assess the frequency of this lesion within clinical subtypes. Three hundred one and 187 cases were examined by 250K and 6.0 arrays, respectively. Forty-six cases were analyzed using both arrays, yielding identical results. Based on the analysis of 1,003 controls, we determined the average size and location of nonclonal regions of autozygosity. All of these nonclonal regions were interstitial. For the purpose of this study, we have excluded all regions of autozygosity based on the size criteria (27 Mb) derived from controls. The remaining regions were confirmed by analysis of germ-line samples (nonclonal CD3+ lymphocytes) in 45 patients (Fig 1A). Regions of homozygosity found in both bone marrow and CD3+ fractions were excluded from further analyses. We confirmed UPD11q detected on 250K arrays by repeated analyses using ultra-high density Affymetrix 6.0 arrays and Genotyping Console version 2.0 software (Fig 1B). Among a total of 133 regions of somatic UPD on multiple chromosomes including 1, 4, 17, and 21, UPD11q was most common (n = 17). LOH can also result from deletions, and deletions involving 11q23.3 were found in 29 patients (Fig 1C). Sequencing c-Cbl revealed mutations in 13 cases (76%) of UPD11q. However, among patients with deletion11q, a c-Cbl mutation was found in only one case (CMML). We also analyzed patients without LOH11q to assess the frequency of heterozygous mutations and identified five cases (1.2%).  Fig 1 Fig 1 Detecting acquired, segmental uniparental disomy (UPD) using single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) technology. (A) SNP-A karyograms of both whole bone marrow (BM) cells and CD3+ lymphocytes of a patient show the somatic nature of acquired UPD in ... c-Cbl Mutations and Clinical Features  We sequenced all exons of c-Cbl; all mutations, except for 1 frame shift mutation in the tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain, were associated with the RFD or linker sequence, which are highly conserved among species. More importantly, 12 mutations in the RFD were located at or next to a cysteine residue (63%; Fig 2). The presence of each somatic mutation was confirmed by bidirectional DNA sequencing of multiple isolates and comparison against CD3+ sorted lymphocytes when possible.  Fig 2. Fig 2. Identification of variations in c-Cbl, Cbl-b and Cbl-c RING finger (RF) domain. Schematic representation shows the major domains of c-Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-c, primarily the tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain, linker sequence (L), RF domain, proline-rich ... In one case of a patient with MDS (refractory anemia subtype) and monosomy 7 who transformed to AML, SNP-A karyotyping revealed the UPD11q, yet after transformation to AML sequencing identified a c-Cbl mutation creating a novel splice site resulting in a longer transcript (Appendix Fig A1, online only). We also found a hemizygous mutation in the linker sequence in a CMML patient with a microdeletion of 11q23.3 previously undetected by metaphase cytogenetics (Appendix Fig A2, online only). Eleven mutations were found in CMML and similar forms of MDS/MPN unclassifiable either at or before the time of testing; 6 of these patients progressed to sAML (55%). In total, two (5%) of 38 patients with CMML, 10 (9%) of 110 with sAML, and one (1%) of 115 patients with MDS carried mutant c-Cbl (Appendix Table A2, online only). In addition, c-Cbl mutations were found in four (19%) of 21 patients with JMML and one (10%) of 10 with CML-BC.  Other Mutations and Nonsynonimous SNPs in Related E3 Ubiquitin Ligases  The Cbl family contains several other E3 ligases, including Cbl-b (3q) and Cbl-c (19q) as well as a novel member with high homology called Hakai (7q). Based on structural and functional similarities we hypothesized that these genes can also harbor mutations associated with similar clinical phenotypes. When we sequenced 12 patients with corresponding UPDs, no mutations were found. However, when we sequenced all patients in our cohort without c-Cbl mutations, we identified three with a heterozygous and one with a hemizygous Cbl-b mutation (Appendix Fig A3, online only) and three patients (one cell line) with a Cbl-c frame shift polymorphism with a single base insertion, all affecting the RFD (Fig 2). In addition, we identified 12 (7%) of 167 patients with myeloid malignancies harboring another rare nonsynonymous SNP in Cbl-c, also affecting the RFD (H405Y). The frequency of this SNP in the general population is less than 1% (data not shown).  Clinical Characteristics in Patients With Cbl Family Mutation  In order to identify the pathologic subtypes in which Cbl family member mutations may play a role, we systematically investigated a wide range of myeloid malignancies. They were most commonly associated with MDS/MPN subentities, including CMML and atypical MDS/MPN, and some cases of typical MDS. In addition, Cbl family mutations appear to be present in sAML with an antecedent history of MDS/MPN. Based on this distribution of c-Cbl mutations, we analyzed other related disease entities within MDS/MPN and MPN; we also identified c-Cbl mutations in JMML and in CML-BC (Appendix Table A2). This pattern suggests that c-Cbl mutations can be a characteristic feature of atypical MDS/MPN syndromes or serve as a second genetic hit facilitating malignant evolution. Our study demonstrates the ubiquitous nature of Cbl family mutations, in particular in the context of very circumscribed phenotypes of myelomonocytic neoplasms.  Several common clinical features were identified among 27 patients affected by the Cbl family of variants, including monoblast or monocyte proliferation (74%), splenomegaly (81%), and surface expression of c-kit on malignant cells (93%). Characteristic nuclear features included abnormal lobulation and hyperchromatic and raisinoid nuclei of megakaryocytes seen in patients with CMML (Appendix Fig A4, online only). By immunohistochemistry, c-Cbl mutant megakaryocyte nuclei displayed aberrant pSTAT5 staining (86%; Appendix Fig A4), while pSTAT5 was not expressed in patients without c-Cbl mutations. In three cases, pSTAT5 expression was not detected in specimens obtained before the mutation was present (Appendix Fig A4). The clinical phenotype of patients with Cbl-b mutations was not distinguishable from that of patients with c-Cbl mutations. The allelic pattern of Cbl family mutations plays an important role in disease phenotype in patients; in sAML eight (62%) of 13 c-Cbl family mutations were homozygous (Fig 3A).  Fig 3. Fig 3. Cbl family mutations in myeloid malignancies and unique clinical characteristics of patients with mutations. (A) Cbl family mutations are frequently observed in secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (sAML; 12%), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms ... To evaluate the impact of Cbl family mutations, we first compared mutant and WT cases on the basis of various clinical parameters (Table 1). In mutant cases, monocyte counts were significantly higher as compared with patients with WT Cbl family genes. A higher proportion of patients with c-Cbl mutations were treated with intense chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation, suggesting that these therapies were more frequently selected because of the aggressive biology of the Cbl mutation-associated disease. When we performed univariate analysis of survival impact of various clinical variables, significant differences in WBC, monocyte counts, disease risk, and the presence of Cbl family gene mutations (Table 2) were found. Chemotherapy was an adverse risk factor for survival, likely as it correlated with more advanced disease in multivariate analyses. The prognosis of patients with Cbl family mutations was poor, especially in those with homozygous mutations. The median overall survival was 5 months for all patients, with a significant difference of 1.7 months versus 20 months for patients with homozygous and heterozygous mutations, respectively (P = .04; Fig 3B). In multivariate analyses advanced disease (hazard ratio [HR], 5.64; 95% CI, 3.8 to 8.36) and Cbl family mutations (HR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.18 to 4.02; Table 3) were shown to be independent adverse factors for overall survival.  Table 1. Table 1. Comparison of Clinical Characteristics Between Wild-Type and Mutant Cbl Family Genes Table 2. Table 2. Univariate Analysis of Overall Survival in Clinical Variables Table 3. Table 3. Multivariate Analysis of Overall Survival in Clinical Variables Go to: DISCUSSION In leukemia, cytogenetic abnormalities identify underlying pathophysiology and carry enormous prognostic and therapeutic significance. Various examples of gain of function and inactivating mutations show that homologous recombination may lead to duplication of affected alleles.24 Consequently, areas of somatic UPD may point toward genes carrying putative pathogenic mutations. When high density SNP-A was applied as a karyotyping platform in a large number of patients with MDS and related disorders, we noted recurrent somatic UPD at chromosome 11q, particularly frequent in MDS/MPN. Commonly deleted region mapping and analysis of genes located within this region led us to hypothesize that c-Cbl may contain mutations. Sequencing of c-Cbl in patients affected by somatic UPD11q revealed RFD and linker sequence mutations present in patients with CMML, MDS/ MPN unclassifiable, and sAML derived from these conditions or MDS. We also found new mutations in Cbl-b with a clinical phenotype similar to that seen with c-Cbl RFD mutations. Consequently, our results imply that E3 ubiquitin ligases constitute a novel class of genes in whom mutations reflect a novel general mechanism of leukemogenesis. This notion is supported by the variety of pathomorphologic subentities of myeloid malignancies affected by mutations of the Cbl family. Moreover, a novel frame shift polymorphism was found in Cbl-c in patients with MDS/MPN. However, the relevance of this otherwise extremely rare polymorphism is not clear as the corresponding gene does not show significant expression in myeloid cells.  Cas-Br-M, a retrovirus, contains v-Cbl which corresponds to about one third of the murine c-Cbl gene and contains only the murine phosphotyrosine binding domain.25 This virus consistently induces a type of pre-B cell lymphoma in infected mice. The importance of c-Cbl in hematopoiesis has been previously demonstrated in knockout mice that show hyper-responsiveness to hematopoietic growth factors, expansion of the progenitor and stem cell pool, and mild myeloproliferative features.17 However, recent results obtained with an RFD knock-in in a c-Cblâˆ’/âˆ’ mouse model parallels the phenotype observed in patients; the mutant mouse demonstrated a severe myeloproliferative phenotype (W.Y. Langdon, personal communication). Indeed, in patients mutations were predominantly located in the RFD and affected structurally essential cysteines, possibly led to inactivation of RFD function by frame shift, or created novel splicing sites resulting in larger transcripts. In addition, c-Cbl mutations were homozygous or hemizygous, implying that the presence of a WT allele is protective. It is likely that mutations do not lead to the simple knockout of c-Cbl function. Rather, by affecting the RFD, they render it a proto-oncogene, consistent with the oncogenic properties of v-Cbl. Previously, mutations of c-Cbl have been described in a limited number of patients with AML, but neither their function nor their clinical phenotype could be delineated without a comprehensive study of corresponding karyotypes and clinical outcomes.26â€“28  c-Cbl is a member of the Cbl family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, which poly- or monoubiquitinate a number of important tyrosine kinases serving as important transduction elements of proliferative signals and activated tyrosine kinase receptors, including Flt-3, c-kit, and M-CSF.29,30 Consequently, inactivation of ubiquitination may lead to enhanced and prolonged signaling, a function which can explain the phenotype in patients (Fig 4). Based on this essential role of E3 ligases, we hypothesized that another Cbl family member, Cbl-b, may also be affected by mutations in myeloid malignancies. Sequencing of these genes in patients who did not harbor c-Cbl mutations revealed that these genes can also be affected by mutations leading to the inactivation of the RFD. These patients displayed a clinical phenotype analogous to those with c-Cbl mutations. The clinical features corresponding to c-Cbl mutations included monocytic features, aberrant and increased phosphorylation of pSTAT5, and monocytoid blasts. An increased frequency of mutations in patients with frank AML may argue either that c-Cbl mutations lead to an invariant progression to an aggressive phenotype, or that they constitute a second hit event frequently occurring in the context of atypical myeloproliferative disorders. In fact, unlike other reports that looked at patients with inv16, we found no mutation of Cbl family genes in de novo AML, including French-American-British type M4 or M5.28 Both theories are supported by the dismal prognosis of patients with Cbl family mutations. The close association of c-Cbl mutations with monocyte expansion, such as that seen in JMML, CMML, or sAML with monocytoid features, suggests a primary role of c-Cbl mutations in the pathogenesis of these diseases, while occurrence of c-Cbl mutations during evolution to AML in serially studied patients and the high proportion of cases with advanced leukemia affected by c-Cbl mutations argues for its auxiliary facilitator role.  Fig 4. Fig 4. Potential intracellular consequences of c-Cbl mutations. c-Cbl is a member of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl family, which poly- or monoubiquitinate a number of important receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), including Flt-3, c-kit, and CSF-1, for degradation. ... Taken together, our data suggests that Cbl family mutations constitute a novel class of pathogenic molecular lesions associated with a spectrum of myeloid malignancies characterized by myeloproliferative features and poor prognosis. Inactivation of the RFD, and thereby ubiquitination involved in downmodulation of proliferative signaling, constitutes a general mechanism of leukemogenesis likely present in a variety of malignancies.

Cbl-c gene is not known to be expressed in myeloid malignancies. â€ Cell line from a patient with secondary AML (sAML).  Despite the discovery of the p.V617F in JAK2, the molecular pathogenesis of some chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms remains unclear. Although very rare, different studies have identified CBL (Cas-Br-Murine ecotropic retroviral transforming sequence) mutations in V617FJAK2-negative patients, mainly located in the RING finger domain. In order to determine the frequency of CBL mutations in these diseases, we studied different regions of all CBL family genes (CBL, CBLB and CBLC) in a selected group of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. We also included V617FJAK2-positive patients to check whether mutations in CBL and JAK2 are mutually exclusive events.  Design and Methods  Using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography, we screened for mutations in CBL, CBLB and CBLC in a group of 172 V617FJAK2-negative and 232 V617FJAK2-positive patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms not selected for loss of heterozygosity. The effect on cell proliferation of the mutations detected was analyzed on a 32D(FLT3) cell model.  Results  An initial screening of all coding exons of CBL, CBLB and CBLC in 44 V617FJAK2-negative samples revealed two new CBL mutations (p.C416W in the RING finger domain and p.A678V in the proline-rich domain). Analyses performed on 128 additional V617FJAK2-negative and 232 V617FJAK2-positive samples detected three CBL changes (p.T402HfsX29, p.P417R and p.S675C in two cases) in four V617FJAK2-positive patients. None of these mutations was found in 200 control samples. Cell proliferation assays showed that all of the mutations promoted hypersensitivity to interleukin-3 in 32D(FLT3) cells.  Conclusions  Although mutations described to date have been found in the RING finger domain and in the linker region of CBL, we found a similar frequency of mutations in the proline-rich domain. In addition, we found CBL mutations in both V617FJAK2-positive (4/232; 1.7%) and negative (2/172; 1.2%) patients and all of them promoted hypersensitivity to interleukin-3.  Keywords: CBL, MPN, mutation analysis Go to: Introduction BCR-ABL1-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are a heterogeneous group of clonal hematologic malignancies characterized by abnormal proliferation and survival of one or more myeloid lineage cells. In some cases these diseases evolve to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These hematologic neoplasms include both classic MPN [essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF)] and atypical MPN (such as chronic eosinophilic leukemia, chronic neutrophilic leukemia, hypereosinophilic syndrome, mast cell disease and myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia, among others).1  In the late 1990s some genetic aberrations were described as molecular disease-causing events in these neoplasms, most of them via fusion genes resulting from reciprocal chromosomal translocations. Such fusions activate tyrosine kinases, playing a role similar to ABL1 in chronic myeloid leukemia.2,3 However these fusions are very rare and most of them have been reported in one or two cases worldwide.4  This situation changed in 2005 with the description of the p.V617F mutation (valine to phenylalanine in amino acid 617) in JAK2, found not only in classic MPN but also in a small number of atypical MPN and other myeloid neoplasms.5 Furthermore, it was found that most of the V617FJAK2-negative cases of PV had other transforming mutations in exon 12 of JAK2. Other gain-of-function mutations have also been described in genes coding for JAK-STAT receptors, such as MPL or EPOR in familial and sporadic cases of MPN.6â€“10 However, to date it is not known whether these mutations cause the full phenotype or whether they cooperate with other still uncharacterized mutations. Thus, there is still a significant proportion of patients in whom the molecular disease-causing event remains to be discovered.  Recently, the application of single nucleotide polymorphism and comparative genomic hybridization array technologies has led to the identification of new mutations in loss of heterozygosity regions affecting genes such as TET2,11 ASXL1,12 IKZF1,13 RUNX1,14 IDH1 and IDH2,15 EZH2,16 NF1,17 and CBL.18â€“23  CBL (11q23) codes for a protein of the Cbl family of E3-ubiquitin ligases (CBL, CBLB and CBLC) that acts as a negative regulator of some cell signaling pathways, by promoting the ubiquitination of several signaling molecules including some tyrosine kinases. CBL proteins share a common structure, with a highly conserved tyrosine kinase-binding domain in the amino-terminal region that determines substrate specificity. The catalytic E3-ubiquitin ligase activity resides in the RING finger domain, which is separated from the tyroskine kinase binding domain by a linker region. CBL and CBLB have two other domains that are not well conserved in CBLC: a proline-rich region involved in the recognition of SH3-proteins, and the carboxy-terminal UBA domain that interacts with ubiquitin molecules allowing dimer formation.24 CBL and CBLB play an important role in cell signaling in the majority of tissues, while CBLC activity seems to be restricted to epithelial cells.25â€“27  Over the last few years several groups have identified CBL mutations in different hematologic neoplasms, although most commonly in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)/MPN such as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.18â€“23,28â€“39 These changes cause the loss of E3-ubiquitin ligase activity, resulting in deregulation of downstream targets and an increase in cell proliferation rates. To our knowledge, CBL mutations seem to be mutually exclusive with other mutations frequently found in these diseases such as Ras mutations, FLT3-ITD or V617FJAK2. In this study we searched for mutations in CBL, CBLB and CBLC in a group of 172 V617FJAK2-negative and 232 V617FJAK2-positive MPN patients not selected for loss of heterozygosity, using a denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) method. Although most of the mutations described previously have been found in the RING finger domain and in the linker region of CBL, we found novel mutations also in the proline-rich domain, both in V617FJAK2-positive and -negative patients.  Go to: Design and Methods Samples  Blood samples were collected from 404 different Caucasian MPN patients without the BCR-ABL1 fusion from several hospitals from the north of Spain. Informed consent was obtained from individual patients and the study was approved by the internal Ethics Committee. The first series of patients included 44 with V617FJAK2-negative MPN (4 diagnosed as PV, 15 as ET, 4 as PMF and 21 as atypical MPN). Later, a second series of 128 V617FJAK2-negative MPN patients (16 PV, 81 ET and 31 PMF) and 232 V617FJAK2-positive MPN patients (69 PV, 149 ET and 14 PMF) were included. The presence/absence of V617FJAK2 mutation was determined in all patients by amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR).40 In addition, all 404 samples were negative for the presence of MPL p.W515 mutations by dHPLC. Human leukemia cell lines HEL, M07e, UKE-1 and SET-2 were also included in the study (Table 1).  Table 1. Table 1. Frequency of CBL mutations found in our series. Initial mutational screening by dHPLC included 20 healthy (no disease) samples used as controls in order to check the frequency of sequence changes observed in our population. For those fragments in which we found sequence variants in patients, we also included 180 additional control samples in order to rule out that the changes detected were population polymorphisms.  Cell lines  Cell proliferation assays were performed on 32Dcl3 (32D) murine myeloid cells (DSMZ N. ACC411) incubated at 37ÂºC in 5% CO2 and maintained in 90% RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 10 ng/mL murine interleukin-3 (Recombinant Mouse IL3, Cat #PMC0035, GibcoÂ®, Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK).  Plasmids  Plasmids with tagged human open reading frames in pCMV6-AC-GFP vectors were purchased from Origene Technologies (Cat #RG214069 for CBL, RG206047 for CBLB and RG205130 for CBLC). The tagged human cDNA clone for FLT3 was also purchased from Origene Technologies as pCMV6-Entry vector (Cat #RC211459) and subcloned into pCMV6-AC-RFP vector (Cat #PS100034). These pCMV6-AC vectors carried the NeoR gene. The pCMVâ€“HA ubiquitin vector was a gift from Dr. Francis Grand from Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory (Salisbury, UK).  Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography analysis  Genomic DNA was obtained from all the samples and amplified with GenomiPhi v2.0 (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) in order to obtain enough material for mutational screening. All mutations were confirmed using the original unamplified sample and no discrepancies were observed with whole-genome amplified DNA.  We designed primers with Primer341 to amplify all coding exons of the three screened genes (CBL, CBLB and CBLC) in flanking introns. For each fragment we also designed a mutant primer introducing a nucleotide change in the forward or reverse primer, depending on the corresponding melting profile, to create a control mutated fragment to validate each dHPLC assay. Melting profiles for PCR fragments, solvent gradients and temperature conditions were calculated by Navigatorâ„¢ Software v1.6.2 (Transgenomic Ltd., Omaha, NE, USA) and validated experimentally. All the analyses were performed on a WAVEÂ® 4500HT System (Transgenomic Ltd., Omaha, NE, USA) with a DNASepÂ® HT cartridge. Online Supplementary Table S1 contains a list of primers, the sizes of the amplified fragments and dHPLC conditions.  PCR reactions were performed with AmpliTaqâ„¢ Gold (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using standard protocols. After cycling, samples were subjected to several cycles of heating and cooling in order to create heteroduplex molecules to improve mutation detection by dHPLC. For each fragment, we sequenced two samples of each different elution profile. Results were analyzed with Mutation Surveyor v3.10 (SoftGenetics LLC, State College, PA, USA) and compared to genomic reference sequences (ENSG00000110395 for CBL, ENSG00000114423 for CBLB and ENSG00000142273 for CBLC).  All coding exons of CBL, CBLB and CBLC were initially analyzed in a group of 44 V617FJAK2-negative patients (4 PV, 4 PMF, 15 ET and 21 atypical MPN). In light of the results we analyzed the RING finger domain coding exons (exons 8 and 9 from CBL, exons 9 and 10 from CBLB and exons 7 and 8 from CBLC) in 128 V617FJAK2-negative (16 PV, 31 PMF, 81 ET) and in 232 V617FJAK2-positive MPN (69 PV, 14 PMF, 149 ET), as well as in human leukemia cell lines M07e, HEL, SET-2 and UKE-1. We also included CBL exon 12 in this extended analysis because we observed a p.A678V change in one sample from the initial series.  CBL exon 8 deletions  Some of the mutations described for CBL are large deletions involving exon 8 (RING finger domain)18,21â€“23,29,30,32,37,42 and the design of our mutation screening assay was not able to detect some of them. We, therefore, designed a new PCR assay with primers located in exon 7 and intron 9 (E7Fw: 5â€™-TCCTGATGGAC-GAAATCAGA-3â€™; E9-Rv: 5â€™-CTCACAATGGATTTTGCCAGT-3â€™) which would amplify a normal fragment of 989 bp. With this assay, any large deletion of exon 8 would be detected as a product of smaller size.  Site-directed mutagenesis  All missense mutations detected for each gene were functionally tested. Mutants p.R420Q (used as the control mutant), p.C416W, p.P417R, p.T402HfsX29, p.S675C and p.A678V for CBL; p.R462W for CBLB and p.Q419PfsX81, p.P435S and p.E392K for CBLC were obtained using the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, La Jolla, CA, USA) from the original plasmids.  Transfection  Transfections were performed with Amaxa NucleofectorÂ® Device II technology (Lonza Cologne GmbH, Basel, Switzerland) according to standard protocols. Cells of the 32D cell line in exponential growth were first transfected with FLT3 vector and maintained in medium until a second CBL/Ubi transfection. From the first transfection with FLT3 vector, cells were grown with Geneticin (G-418 sulfate, Cat #11811 GibcoÂ®, Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK) to select those clones that had incorporated the vector.  Cell proliferation assays  Proliferation analysis was performed with the CellTiter 96Â® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS, Ref #G3580, Promega Corp, Madison, WI, USA) according to standard protocols, comparing cells transfected with wild-type CBL (CBL, CBLB or CBLC in each case) with cells transfected with mutant CBL during 3 or 4 days, in triplicate. In each case we carried out four different experiments, also including 32D(FLT3) cells transfected with pCMV6-AC-GFP and mock-transfected 32D(FLT3) cells as controls. In all cases cells were supplemented with 10 ng/mL recombinant human FLT3-ligand (Cat #GF038, Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA) and with 10 ng/mL murine interleukin-3 (Recombinant Mouse IL3, Cat #PMC0035, GibcoÂ®, Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, UK). As the positive mutant control we used p.R420Q, a previously described CBL mutant with an effect on cell proliferation.28  Statistical analysis  Results from MTS proliferation assays were compared using the Studentâ€™s t-test implemented in UNStat (a free tool available at http://www.unav.es/departamento/genetica/unstat).  Go to: Results Mutational screening  In the initial screening of all coding exons of CBL, CBLB and CBLC in 44 patients with V617FJAK2-negative MPN we detected two missense changes not previously described in CBL (2/44; 4.5%). In this first series we also found three missense changes in CBLC described as single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs35457630, rs3208856, rs116023028) in the RING finger domain and proline-rich region. These changes were detected in samples from both patients and controls. No missense changes were detected in CBLB.  CBL changes (p.C416W or g.72251T>G and p.A678V or g.81664C>T) were found in patients diagnosed with atypical MPN, although the disease in the patient with p.A678V later evolved to CMML because of the development of dysplastic features. Whereas p.C416W affected the RING finger domain, like other mutations previously reported, p.A678V was located in exon 12, which codes for the proline-rich domain of CBL (see Figure 1). For this reason, we decided to include this exon in the analysis of CBL in an additional group of patients.  Figure 1. Figure 1. (A) CBL mutations described to date in myeloid malignancies. Mutations found in our analysis are colored in red. In contrast to other studies in which mutations were found in the linker region (LR) and the RING finger domain, we also found two novel changes ... When we analyzed exon 12 of CBL and the RING finger domains of CBL, CBLB and CBLC in the additional series of samples (128 V617FJAK2-negative and 232 V617FJAK2-positive patients), we found three CBL changes in four V617FJAK2-positive patients (4/232, 1.7%). The first one (detected in a patient with ET) was a not previously reported g.71955_71955A deletion in exon 8. This is a frameshift change that truncates the RING finger domain with loss of the proline-rich and UBA carboxy-terminal domains (p.T402HfsX29) (Figure 1). The second change was a substitution g.72253C>G (p.P417R) in exon 9 in a patient diagnosed with PMF, also affecting the RING finger domain and previously identified in a patient with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.37 Finally, the third CBL mutation was a not previously reported g.81655C>G substitution (p.S675C) in exon 12 (proline-rich region). Remarkably, this change was detected in two different V617FJAK2-positive patients, one with ET and the other with PV. None of the 200 control samples analyzed showed any of these changes. CBL exon 8 deletions were not observed in any case.  We also detected a not previously reported substitution (g.149486C>T, p.R462W) in the RING finger domain of CBLB in a sample from a V617FJAK2-positive patient with PV (1/232; 0.4%). In CBLC, we detected one frameshift change (g.15702_15703insC, p.Q419PfsX81), in a patient with V617FJAK2-negative PV, which has been described as a polymorphism (rs66944506).  None of the cell lines included in these analyses (HEL, SET-2, UKE-1 and M07e) showed any CBL, CBLB or CBLC mutation.  CBL mutations promote hypersensitivity to interleukin-3 in 32D(FLT3) cells  A significantly higher number of cells was observed in 32D(FLT3) cells transfected with CBL mutants than with wild-type CBL (P<0.05, Figure 2), grouping data from four independent cell proliferation assays. In addition, cells transfected with mutant vectors showed significantly higher proliferation rates in all cases (P<0.05, Figure 2) and with stronger effects than those observed for the p.R420Q control mutation.  Figure 2. Figure 2. (A to F) All missense mutations detected in CBL were functionally tested. Left, results of cell proliferation assays corresponding to four different transfections for each mutation. Two transfection controls (cells mock-transfected and cells transfected ... By contrast, assays for p.R462W in CBLB and for p.Q419PfsX81, p.E392K and p.P435S in CBLC (Online Supplementary Figure S1) showed no significant differences (P>0.05) in proliferation rates.  Go to: Discussion In the last few years the detection of regions with acquired loss of heterozygosity in some patients, mainly caused by acquired uniparental disomy, has allowed the identification of candidate genes that may be mutated in myeloid neoplasms. One of these genes is CBL, which codes for an E3-ubiquitin ligase protein. Cbl family proteins (CBL, CBLB and CBLC) play an important role as regulators of several signaling pathways promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of some RTK and CTK,44 many of which are involved in these diseases.4,45,46  The first CBL mutation identified was p.R420Q, affecting the RING finger domain in a patient with AML.28 Subsequently, other mutations have been reported with variable frequencies in myeloid neoplasms, affecting not only the RING finger domain but also the linker region (Figure 1). These events have been observed in 1â€“33% cases of secondary AML, 1â€“7% of MPN and 2â€“33% of MDS/MPN and AML,18â€“23,28â€“39 but their frequencies could be as high as 85â€“90% in patients with loss of heterozygosity in 11q.18â€“20,22,23,33 Some reports have also described that 7% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer have CBL mutations, so this gene can be mutated in other types of tumor.47 CBLB mutations and CBLC missense polymorphisms affecting the RING finger domain have also been described in myeloid neoplasms but at a lower frequency and with unknown effects.22,23,29  In this study we searched for mutations in CBL, CBLB and CBLC in a cohort of 404 V617FJAK2-negative and -positive MPN patients not selected for the presence of loss of heterozygosity in 11q. Our results show that CBL is mutated in V617FJAK2-negative MPN at a frequency similar to that previously reported (p.C416W and p.A678V; 1.2%, 2/172, Table 1).49 Both patients with mutations were initially diagnosed as having atypical MPN (2/21; 9.5%), although in one of them the disease evolved to CMML due to the development of dysplastic features. CMML is the disease with the highest frequency of CBL mutations reported to date.18â€“20,22,34 None of these mutations had been previously described and, notably, p.A678V was located in the proline-rich domain. In V617JAK2-positive MPN we found two mutations affecting the RING finger domain (p.T402HfsX29 in a patient with ET and p.P417R in a patient with PMF) and a recurrent change in the proline-rich domain (p.S675C in a patient with ET and in another one with PV) of CBL. Although TET2, ASXL1 and JAK2 mutations have been found concurrently,50 CBL mutations and V617FJAK2 seemed to be mutually exclusive events.13,21,26,51 However, we have found a similar frequency of CBL mutations in both V617FJAK2-positive and V617FJAK2-negative patients (Table 1), suggesting that the prevalence of CBL mutations could increase if V617FJAK2-positive patients were also included in CBL mutational studies. Unfortunately, we cannot know whether both mutations are in the same or in different clones or whether they are monoallelic or biallelic because of the type of sample available. None of the V617FJAK2-positive cell lines analyzed (HEL, SET-2 and UKE-1) showed CBL mutations that might help us to elucidate how both events could cooperate to drive the disease.43  In order to determine the effect of all these mutations on cell proliferation, in vitro functional assays were performed. All CBL mutations induced a hyperproliferative response to interleukin-3 in the 32D(FLT3) model, similar to that induced by the well-characterized p.R420Q mutation.28,31 This effect was not observed for the mutations detected in CBLB and CBLC. CBL was initially described as a putative tumor suppressor gene because of its negative regulatory function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Most of the mutations reported are located in conserved residues of the linker region and RING finger domain and could impair this regulatory function.44,46,52 RING finger domain mutations p.T402HfsX29, p.C416W and p.P417R described in this work also affect conserved residues of the protein (Figure 3) with a similar effect on the loss of activity of CBL.  Figure 3. Figure 3. Evolutionary conservation of the CBL regions in which mutations have been detected. Sequence comparison between humans (Homo sapiens) and other mammals (Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Pan troglodytes, Bos taurus, Macaca mulatta and Equus caballus) in ... Notably, we found two additional, novel mutations (one of them recurrent) affecting conserved residues in the pro-line-rich region (p.A678V and p.S675C, Figure 3) which also promote cell proliferation. In fact, we found similar frequencies of mutations in RING finger and proline-rich domains. The proline-rich region is essential for the interaction of CBL with the adaptor proteins (such as Grb2 and FRs2Î±) needed to maintain a stable attachment between CBL and its substrate,52 with proteins involved in the endocytosis of target receptors (such as SH3KBP1)46 and with several signaling proteins (such as the Src family).46  As in previous studies, we observed that mock-transfected cells showed greater growth than cells transfected with wild-type CBL, but less than cells transfected with mutant CBL. This fact is concordant with the proposal by some authors of a dominant negative effect of CBL mutant forms on endogenous wild-type CBL, making it unable to perform its negative regulatory function and promoting intracellular signaling and higher cell proliferation rates.18,26,27 However, in vivo studies have shown that the presence of gain-of-function mutants with a dominant effect over endogenous CBL is not enough to develop a myeloproliferative disease.18,26,27 A possible explanation for this phenomenon could be the activity of wild-type CBL as a positive regulator of cell growth contributing to the activation of pathways such as PI3K, Ras/MAPK and Src.52,53 Under normal conditions, the negative regulatory activity of CBL could mask its activity as a positive regulator, but the lack of E3-ubiquitin ligase activity could reveal its signaling enhancing activity.27 This could be the reason for the non-transforming effect of the p.R462W CBLB mutant in 32D(FLT3) cells. CBLB does not show the positive regulatory effects of CBL52 and perhaps the loss of its E3-ubiquitin ligase activity is not enough to promote cell proliferation. In fact, although CBLB activity seems to be similar to that of CBL in hematologic cells, very few cases of myeloid neoplasms with CBLB mutations have been reported.25,29  Finally, the results obtained in CBLC suggest that missense single nucleotide polymorphisms do not increase cell proliferation in our model. Wild-type CBLC induced higher proliferation rates in 32D(FLT3) cells than wild-type CBL in all assays (Online Supplementary Figure S1) possibly due to the absence of an inhibitory role of CBLC in hematologic cells.25,54,55  In conclusion, we have identified mutations in the proline-rich region of CBL in patients with MPN and also in V617FJAK2-positive patients. Although the entire CBL coding sequence has been investigated in some studies (by sequencing, not by dHPLC),18,19,22,32 most research in recent years has focused only on exons coding for the linker region and RING finger domain20,21,23,28,30,31,33â€“36,38 and in patients without other frequent genetic aberrations, such as mutations in JAK2.26 Proline-rich domain mutations (p.S675C and p.A678V) confer hypersensitivity to cytokines in the 32D(FLT3) model in a similar way to RING finger domain mutations (p.T402HfsX29, p.C416W and p.P427R), suggesting that they should also be considered in analyses of CBL. Although these events seem to be rare in MPN, our data highlight the importance of reevaluating the prevalence of CBL mutations in other regions of the gene in myeloid neoplasms. This could be of special interest in MDS/MPN because of the high incidence of CBL mutations in these diseases. In addition, further functional analyses of these genetic events could help us to understand the cellular functions of CBL and the role of the different protein domains. It is well known that CBL activity is mediated by the activation of different RTK, so the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (such as anti-FLT3) or other signal transduction inhibitors could also be effective in the treatment of patients with CBL mutations.27,32,56  \n",

hypersensitivity to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). SHP2, NF-1, KRAS, and NRAS are mutated in JMML patients, leading to aberrant regulation of RAS signaling. A subset of JMML patients harbor CBL mutations associated with 11q acquired uniparental disomy. Many of these mutations are in the linker region and the RING finger of CBL, leading to a loss of E3 ligase activity. We investigated the mechanism by which CBL-Y371H, a linker region mutant, and CBL-C384R, a RING finger mutant, lead to enhanced GM-CSF signaling. Expression of CBL mutants in the TF-1 cell line resulted in enhanced survival in the absence of GM-CSF. Cells expressing CBL mutations displayed increased phosphorylation of GM-CSF receptor Î²c subunit in response to stimulation, although expression of total GM-CSFR Î²c was lower. This suggested enhanced kinase activity downstream of GM-CSFR. JAK2 and LYN kinase expression is elevated in CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutant cells, resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of CBL and S6 in response to GM-CSF stimulation. Incubation with the JAK2 inhibitor, TG101348, abolished the increased phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c in cells expressing CBL mutants, whereas treatment with the SRC kinase inhibitor dasatinib resulted in equalization of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation signal between wild type CBL and CBL mutant samples. Dasatinib treatment inhibited the elevated phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants. Our study indicates that CBL linker and RING finger mutants lead to enhanced GM-CSF signaling due to elevated kinase expression, which can be blocked using small molecule inhibitors targeting specific downstream pathways.  Keywords: Cytokine, E3 Ubiquitin Ligase, JAK Kinase, Signal Transduction, SRC, CBL, GM-CSF, Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia Go to: Introduction Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a cytokine that regulates the differentiation, survival, proliferation, and functional activation of granulocytes and monocytes in the myeloid lineage (1). In order to mediate its functional activity, GM-CSF binds to its receptor, the GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSFR),2 consisting of GM-CSR Î± and GM-CSFR Î² common (Î²c) subunits. The Î²c subunit of the receptor is shared by the IL-3 and IL-5 receptors. Î²c is the major signaling subunit and is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to cytokine stimulation. Î²c phosphorylation results in the recruitment of various effectors leading to activation of downstream signaling (2â€“4). GM-CSFR Î± is the major binding subunit, which dictates the binding specificity of the receptor complex for GM-CSF (2, 4, 5). The engagement of GM-CSFR by GM-CSF results in the formation of a dodecameric complex of GM-CSFÂ·GM-CSFR Î±Â·GM-CSFR Î²c, which leads to the trans-phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c-associated JAK2 kinases (6). The activated JAK2 kinases phosphorylate GM-CSFR Î²c tyrosine residues, allowing for the recruitment of various effectors and the activation of downstream signaling. GM-CSF stimulation results in the activation of the JAK-STAT, PI3K, and the RAS/MAPK pathways, contributing to GM-CSF-mediated differentiation, proliferation, and survival (reviewed in Refs. 1 and 4).  GM-CSF hypersensitivity is one of the defining characteristics of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). This disease is classified by the World Health Organization as a mixed myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease (7). JMML patients must show persistent monocytosis in the absence of the BCR-ABL oncogene (8). Genetic lesions deregulating the RAS signaling pathway have been identified to lead to JMML pathogenesis. 10â€“15% of JMML patients harbor mutations in neurofibromin protein (NF1) (9, 10), a GTPase-activating protein, which negatively regulates RAS by enhancing the hydrolysis of the active GTP-bound conformation of RAS to the inactive GDP-bound form (11). 35% of JMML patients have mutations in SHP2 (12â€“14), a protein-tyrosine phosphatase that positively regulates the RAS signaling pathway (15, 16). RAS-activating mutations account for another 20â€“25% of JMML-associated mutations (17â€“19). Several groups determined that a proportion of JMML patients have 11q uniparental disomy. CBL mutations were identified upon further analysis of the 11q uniparental disomy samples (20â€“22). The presence of NF1, SHP2, RAS, and CBL mutations are mutually exclusive, raising the question of how CBL mutations can lead to disease development.  CBL mutations have been identified in numerous other myeloid malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic, myeloproliferative, and mixed myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease (23â€“28). The majority of these mutations localize to the CBL linker region or the RING finger. CBL is a ubiquitin E3 ligase, which specifies target proteins for ubiquitination. The linker region and RING finger of CBL play very important roles in its E3 ligase functionality. The linker region contains two conserved tyrosine residues, Tyr-368 and Tyr-371, whose phosphorylation activates and positively regulates E3 ligase activity of CBL (29â€“31). The CBL RING finger is responsible for recruiting active E2s carrying an ubiquitin moiety, allowing for the transfer of ubiquitin to the target substrate (29, 32). Therefore, it is not surprising that mutations in the linker region and RING finger of CBL identified in myeloid malignancies result in a loss of E3 ligase activity.  JMML is associated with GM-CSF hypersensitivity; however, there is a lack of evidence that specifically examines the role of CBL downstream of the GM-CSF receptor and how JMML-associated CBL mutations may affect GM-CSF signaling. CBL is known to become phosphorylated downstream of the Î²c in response to stimulation by IL-3 (33, 34) and GM-CSF (35, 36). Furthermore, CBL associates with the Î²c subunit upon IL-5 stimulation (37). However, these studies do not directly address the role of CBL in GM-CSF signaling.  The objective of this study is to investigate how JMML-associated CBL mutations modulate GM-CSF signaling and lead to GM-CSF hypersensitivity. We expressed wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R in the human TF-1 hematopoietic cell line, which expresses the endogenous GM-CSF receptor at physiological levels (38). Upon GM-CSF stimulation, elevated phosphorylation of GM-CSF Î²c was observed, resulting from elevated JAK2 and LYN phosphorylation. Expression of CBL JMML mutants resulted in enhanced S6 phosphorylation and increased cell survival. Treatment with pharmacologic inhibitors delineated which proximal GM-CSF-dependent pathways are dependent on JAK2 and LYN activation. In summary, our data show that CBL JMML mutants result in enhanced GM-CSF signaling via modulation of JAK2 and LYN tyrosine kinases.  Go to: EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Constructs pMSCV-HA-CBL retroviral vectors were used to create JMML-associated CBL mutants. HA-tagged CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R were constructed using QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kits (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol.  Retrovirus Production HEK 293T cells were plated onto 10-cm dishes (Sarstedt) and grown to around 75% confluence. The 293T cells were transiently transfected with pSV (Gag and Pol proteins) and pVSV-G (envelope protein) and pMSCV-GFP retroviral vectors expressing HA-wild type CBL, HA-CBL-Y371H, or HA-CBL-C384R using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as directed in the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 4.5 Î¼g of pSV, 1.5 Î¼g of VSV-G, and 4.5 Î¼g of pMSCV-IRES-GFP-HA-CBL constructs were mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 in serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM H-21 for 20 min at room temperature. 293T cells were washed with serum-free DMEM H-21, and 4 ml of serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM H-21 was added to the cells. DNA-Lipofectamine 2000 mixture was added to the plated cells and incubated for 6 h at 37 Â°C. Transfection medium was removed from the cells, and 10 ml of RPMI 1640 medium with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum was added. Transfected 293T supernatant containing VSV-G pseudotyped virus carrying pMSCV-HA-CBL was collected at 48 and 72 h post-transfection.  Cell Lines and Culture TF-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 Î¼g of streptomycin/ml, and 2 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF. In order to stably express wild type and mutant CBL, TF-1 cells were infected with VSV-G pseudotyped retrovirus carrying wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R constructs. TF-1 cells were suspended in retroviral supernatant supplemented with 8 ng/ml Polybrene and centrifuged in 50-ml tubes at 12,000 rpm for 75 min. TF-1 cells were resuspended in fresh retroviral Polybrene solution and incubated overnight in 6-well dishes at 37 Â°C. A final round of spinoculation with fresh retroviral supernatant was performed on day 2. TF-1 cells were allowed to expand for 48 h. GFP-positive infected TF-1 cells expressing HA-CBL constructs were purified using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).  XTT Assay TF-1 cells were cytokine-depleted overnight, as described below. 2000 cells were transferred to each well of a 96-well plate in a final volume of 100 Î¼l of RPMI, 10% FCS with the indicated concentrations of GM-CSF. Plates were incubated at 37 Â°C for 48 h prior to the addition of 3 Î¼m phenazine methosulfate (Sigma) and 2 mg/ml XTT (Diagnostic Chemicals). The cells were incubated with the XTT/phenazine methosulfate solution for 6 h at 37 Â°C. The absorption of the reduction product at 450 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer plate reader.  Annexin V Flow Cytometric Analysis TF-1 cells were cytokine-depleted and maintained in cytokine-free media for 72 h. Cells were stained with annexin V-phycoerythrin (PE) according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Pharmingen). Stained cells were analyzed using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer.  Cytokine Deprivation, Stimulation, and Lysis TF-1 cells were washed three times in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), Hanks' balanced salts; depleted in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum overnight at 37 Â°C; and then stimulated with 0.5 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF. Proteasomal and lysosomal degradation was inhibited by incubation of cells with 30 Î¼m MG132 (Calbiochem/Millipore) and 100 Î¼m chloroquine (Sigma), respectively, for 2 h prior to stimulation. JAK2 and LYN kinase activity was inhibited by treatment with 2 m TG101348 (generously provided by Dr. R. Levine) for 4 h or with 0.1 m dasatinib (gift from Dr. D. Hedley) for 2 h, respectively. TF-1 cells were stimulated with 0.5 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF for the indicated times at 37 Â°C.  The cells were washed once in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), Hanks' balanced salts containing 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and supplemented with â€œcOmpleteâ€� protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). After 5 min on ice, the lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 Ã— g for 5 min at 4 Â°C.  Antibodies The 4G10 phosphotyrosine-specific monoclonal antibody and anti-ERK1/2 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology/Millipore. Anti-IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSFR Î²c N-20 (used for immunoblotting) and K-17 (used for immunoprecipitations)), anti-Shp2, and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies specific for phospho-JAK2 (Tyr-1007/1008), JAK2, phospho-SRC family (Tyr-416), phospho-Ser-235/236 S6, and Lynp56 were acquired from Cell Signaling Technologies. An anti-phospho STAT5a/b antibodies were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc./Invitrogen. Anti-STAT5 antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. The monoclonal 12CA5 anti-HA antibody was acquired from Roche Applied Science.  Immunoprecipitations Antibodies along with a 50-Î¼l volume of protein A or protein G-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to 2 mg of lysates for an overnight incubation at 4 Â°C. The beads were washed three times in ice-cold lysis buffer. The immune complexes were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm DTT. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane for Western blotting.  Western Blotting Following the electrophoretic transfer of proteins to PVDF membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), the membranes were blocked at room temperature with 2.5% BSA (w/v) or 5% nonfat dry milk (w/v) in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl) with Tween 20 for 1 h. Membranes were then incubated with an optimal concentration of the primary antibody in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 Â°C. Membranes were washed four times in TBST and incubated with the relevant HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 30â€“60 min. Membranes were washed four times in TBST and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence with autoradiographic film (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). For reprobing, membranes were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 0.1 m Î²-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 Â°C; rinsed twice in TBST; and blocked in 2.5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline prior to primary antibody incubation. Western blots were scanned and quantified using ImageJ software. Quantified Western blots are presented as mean Â± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test.  Go to: RESULTS Enhanced and Prolonged Phosphorylation of the GM-CSFR Î²c in CBL Mutant-expressing Cells GM-CSF hypersensitivity is one of the hallmark features of JMML (39). We utilized the TF-1 hematopoietic cell line to investigate the role of JMML-associated CBL mutations in vitro. TF-1 cells endogenously express the GM-CSF receptor Î± (GM-CSFRÎ±) and the IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSF receptor Î² common chain (GM-CSFR Î²c), and are responsive to GM-CSF. HA-tagged wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R mutants were stably expressed in TF-1 cells (Fig. 1A). All exogenous constructs showed high expression of CBL when compared with vector-infected cells (Fig. 1A). This is especially advantageous because studies have shown that expression of wild type CBL can rescue or mask the effects of CBL mutants (23, 40).  FIGURE 1. FIGURE 1. Enhanced phosphorylation of GM-CSF receptor Î²c upon expression of CBL mutants.

Binding of GM-CSF to the GM-CSF receptor complex activates JAK2, leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c. In order to investigate the effects of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants on GM-CSF signaling, we examined the phosphorylation of the GM-CSFR Î²c after stimulation. TF-1 cells expressing wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R were cytokine-depleted and stimulated with GM-CSF. GM-CSFR Î²c was immunoprecipitated from lysates and immunoblotted with the 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Upon GM-CSF stimulation, cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 8 and 9) show enhanced phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c compared with the wild type CBL controls (lanes 2 and 3). Furthermore, prolonged phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c was observed in CBL mutant samples.  CBL plays an important role in stimulation-induced endocytosis, trafficking, and degradation of numerous tyrosine kinase (29, 32) and cytokine receptors (41, 42). To determine whether expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants has an effect on the expression of the GM-CSFR Î²c, as well as its GM-CSF induced degradation, lysates collected from GM-CSF-stimulated TF-1 cells were probed for GM-CSFR Î²c. Because it is likely that CBL-Y371H (23, 30) and CBL-C384R (43) mutations result in a loss of CBL E3 ligase activity, GM-CSFR Î²c levels were expected to be higher in mutant CBL-expressing cells. Surprisingly, expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R (Fig. 2A, lanes 4â€“9) results in a decrease in GM-CSFR Î²c compared with wild type CBL (lanes 1â€“3)-expressing cells at 0, 10, and 60 min (Fig. 2B). However, it is important to note that GM-CSFR Î²c expression decreased after GM-CSF stimulation in wild type and mutant CBL-expressing cells at comparable rates. These results indicate that although expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R results in an overall decreased expression of GM-CSFR Î²c, the degradation of the receptor poststimulation appears not to be disrupted.  FIGURE 2. FIGURE 2. TF-1 cells expressing CBL mutants have lower expression levels of GM-CSFR Î²c. Lysates were collected as described in the legend to Fig. 1. A, immunoblotting (IB) was performed with GM-CSFR Î²c-specific antibody. Blots were reprobed for ... Elevated Levels of JAK2 Kinase in CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing TF-1 Cells Upon binding of GM-CSF to GM-CSFRÎ±, a GM-CSFR Î²c homodimer is recruited (6), bringing the Î²c-associated JAK2 kinase (44, 45) into close proximity, allowing transphosphorylation and subsequent activation of the kinase. Activation of JAK2 is essential for downstream GM-CSF signaling (46, 47). The enhanced and prolonged phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c, along with a decrease in the overall expression of the receptor in CBL mutant-expressing cells may be indicative of elevated kinase activity downstream of GM-CSFR Î²c. Because JAK2 is the main tyrosine kinase downstream of GM-CSFR, the GM-CSF-induced activation of JAK2 was assessed. TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R displayed elevated levels of phosphorylated JAK2 upon GM-CSF stimulation (Fig. 3A, top, lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 8 and 9), compared with the wild type CBL controls (lanes 2 and 3). Reprobing for total JAK2, revealed that the observed enhancement of the phospho-JAK2 signal may be due to an increase in the expression of JAK2 in CBL mutant-expressing cells (Fig. 3, A (middle, lanes 4â€“9) and B).  FIGURE 3. FIGURE 3. Expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants results in elevated JAK2. A, lysates collected from TF-1 cells expressing wild type and CBL mutants were probed for phospho-Tyr-1007/1008 JAK2 and reprobed for total JAK2 and tubulin. B, blots were quantified ... Linker and RING finger mutations disrupt the E3 ligase activity of CBL (29, 31, 32). Such loss of E3 ligase activity has been shown to result in a significant decrease in the EPO-induced ubiquitination of JAK2 (23). In order to determine whether the increase in total JAK2 in CBL mutant expressing cell lines was due to compromised ubiquitination and degradation of the kinase, TF-1 cells expressing wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R were treated with proteasomal (MG-132) and lysosomal (chloroquine) inhibitors prior to stimulation. Inhibition of proteasomal and lysosomal degradation stabilized JAK2 to comparable levels in all three cell lines (Fig. 3C, middle). These results indicate that the expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants affects the degradation of JAK2, leading to elevated levels, which in turn contribute to increased JAK2 phosphorylation and potentially signaling in response to GM-CSF stimulation.  Increased Expression of LYN Kinase in CBL Mutant Cells Although JAK2 is the primary kinase activated downstream of GM-CSF receptor, members of the SRC family kinase are stimulated in response to GM-CSF (48â€“50). Specifically, LYN has been shown to directly associate with GM-CSFR Î²c (51) and to play an important role in mediating the anti-apoptotic effects of GM-CSF in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (49, 52). LYN also associates with GM-CSFRÎ± and is involved in the survival signal required for factor-independent growth of cells expressing the FIÎ” GM-CSFR Î²c mutant (48). Considering that TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R show enhanced survival while exhibiting lower expression of GM-CSFR Î²c, we wanted to determine whether LYN phosphorylation and/or expression was altered in CBL mutant-expressing cells. Lysates collected from GM-CSF-stimulated cells were probed with an antibody specific for pY396-LYN, residing in a phosphorylated motif within the LYN activation loop. Increased LYN phosphorylation was observed in cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants (Fig. 4A, top, lanes 4â€“9), compared with those expressing wild type CBL (lanes 1â€“3). Reprobing for total LYN revealed that CBL mutant cells have increased levels of LYN (p56) (Fig. 4, A (middle, lanes 4â€“9) and B). This observed increase in LYN expression leads to elevated LYN phosphorylation, which may contribute to the enhanced survival of CBL mutant TF-1 cells.  FIGURE 4. FIGURE 4. Increased expression of LYN kinase in CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutant TF-1 cells. A, whole cell lysates collected from TF-1 cells expressing CBL-WT and CBL mutants were immunoblotted with antibodies specific for Tyr(P)-396-LYN. Blots were reprobed for ... Similar to JAK2, treatment with MG-132 and chloroquine stabilized total LYN levels to comparable levels in wild type and mutant cells, indicating that the increase in LYN levels is probably due to the loss of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the CBL mutants (Fig. 4C).  Expression of CBL Mutants Results in Constitutive S6 Phosphorylation and Enhanced Factor-free Survival Investigation of signaling effectors further downstream of the GM-CSF receptor revealed enhanced phosphorylation of SHP2 in CBL mutant-expressing cells relative to wild type CBL controls (Fig. 5A). Constitutive phosphorylation of S6 in TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R, compared with wild type CBL-expressing controls (Fig. 5B), was also observed. No significant differences were observed in the phosphorylation of STAT5 or ERK1/2 (Fig. 5C) between wild type CBL- and mutant CBL-expressing TF-1 cells after GM-CSF stimulation.  FIGURE 5. FIGURE 5. Expression of CBL mutants results in constitutive phosphorylation of S6 and enhanced survival of TF-1 cells. A, SHP2 immunoprecipitations (IP) were performed on lysates collected from TF-1 cells expressing CBL-WT, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R, which were ... XTT assays were performed to determine whether the expression of the CBL linker and RING finger mutants results in enhanced survival and growth. TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants displayed enhanced survival in the absence of GM-CSF relative to cells expressing wild type CBL (Fig. 5D). The increase in the survival of the mutant-expressing cells decreases with increasing concentration of GM-CSF. Cell counting assays were also performed to confirm these results (data not shown). To determine whether the increase in survival was due to a decrease in apoptosis, annexin V staining was performed on cytokine-deprived wild type and mutant CBL-expressing cells. There was a decrease in annexin V-positive TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H relative to wild type CBL-expressing controls, whereas the proportion of annexin V-positive CBL-C384R-expressing cells was comparable with wild type CBL controls (Fig. 5E). These results indicate that JMML-associated CBL mutations result in enhanced survival of TF-1 cells at low doses of GM-CSF.  Constitutive and Enhanced Phosphorylation of CBL Mutants Is Dependent on an SRC Family Kinase CBL is phosphorylated downstream of numerous oncogenic protein-tyrosine kinases (BCR/ABL and v-SRC), receptor tyrosine kinases (PDGF-R, FLT-3, and c-KIT), and cytokine receptors (TPO and EPO) (reviewed in Ref. 53). For example, CBL is tyrosine-phosphorylated downstream of the Î²c chain in response to IL-3 (33, 34) and GM-CSF (35, 36).  The carboxyl-terminal region of CBL contains three major tyrosine phosphorylation sites, Tyr-700, Tyr-731, and Tyr-774 (54). Phosphorylation of these tyrosines leads to the recruitment of SRC homology 2 domain-containing effectors. Phosphorylated Tyr-700 of CBL binds the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, VAV (55). Phosphorylated Tyr-731 acts as the binding site for the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (56, 57), and members of the CRK adaptor protein family have been shown to bind both phosphorylated Tyr-700 and Tyr-774 (58â€“60). Downstream pathways mediated by CBL tyrosine phosphorylation sites play an important role in CBL-mediated signaling. Linker region mutations of CBL have been shown to lead to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL in Ba/F3-FLT3 cells (24).  We were interested in determining whether expression of the linker region Y371H and the RING finger C384R mutations would result in altered CBL tyrosine phosphorylation. CBL was immunoprecipitated from wild type and mutant CBL TF-1 lysates, and phosphorylation was assessed by Tyr(P) immunoblotting (Fig. 6). CBL-Y371H (lanes 4â€“6) and CBL-C384R (lanes 7â€“9) were highly phosphorylated compared with CBL wild type controls (lanes 1â€“3). Both CBL mutants showed constitutive phosphorylation in the absence of GM-CSF stimulation (lanes 4 and 7).  FIGURE 6. FIGURE 6. Dasatinib treatment abolishes the enhanced phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R. TF-1 cells expressing WT and mutant CBL were incubated with dasatinib and TG101348 for 2 and 4 h, respectively, prior to GM-CSF stimulation. Cells were lysed, and HA ... Although numerous members of the SRC family kinases, including LYN (61â€“63), are capable of phosphorylating CBL, there is evidence that Janus kinase family members may also target CBL for tyrosine phosphorylation (64). To determine whether inhibition of JAK2 or SRC family kinases could abolish the enhanced and constitutive phosphorylation of CBL, TF-1 cells expressing wild type and mutant CBL were treated with either the JAK2-specific inhibitor TG101348 or the SRC family kinase inhibitor dasatinib prior to stimulation. The constitutive and enhanced phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants (lanes 22â€“27) persisted in TG101348-treated samples (Fig. 6), whereas pretreatment with dasatinib abolished the elevated phosphorylation of CBL mutants (lanes 13â€“18) to levels comparable with wild type CBL controls (lanes 10â€“12). These results indicate that downstream of the GM-CSF receptor, CBL is phosphorylated by a SRC family kinase, potentially LYN, and mutations in the linker region or the RING finger domain of CBL lead to not only enhanced but also constitutive phosphorylation of CBL.  TG101348-mediated Inhibition of Enhanced Phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c in CBL Mutant-expressing Cells We were interested in determining how the inhibition of JAK2 or SRC family kinases downstream of GM-CSFR would modulate the elevated phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c observed in CBL mutant-expressing cells (Figs. 1B and â€‹and7,7, lanes 1â€“9). TF-1 cells were treated with TG101348 and dasatinib, alone or in combination, prior to stimulation and subsequent GM-CSFR Î²c immunoprecipitation. TG101348 treatment resulted in a significant inhibition of GM-CSF-induced phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c in both wild type CBL- and CBL mutant-expressing cells, resulting in an equally down-modulated level of the phosphorylated receptor (Fig. 7, lanes 10â€“18). This was expected, because JAK2 is known to be the kinase responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of the GM-CSFR Î²c in response to stimulation (47, 65, 66).  FIGURE 7. FIGURE 7. Inhibition of JAK2 activity via treatment with TG101348 abolishes the enhanced phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î² in CBL mutant-expressing cells. TF-1 cells expressing WT-CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R were cytokine-depleted and treated with 2 mm TG101348 ... Interestingly, inhibition of SRC family kinases did not result in the inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation, but it did result in an equivalent level of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation in wild type CBL and CBL mutant samples (Fig. 7, lanes 19â€“27). Treatment with both TG101348 and dasatinib inhibited GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation (Fig. 7, lanes 28â€“36) to similar levels observed in samples treated with only TG101348.  Go to: DISCUSSION Hypersensitivity to GM-CSF is one of the defining characteristics of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Until recently, genes mutated in JMML patients (NF1, SHP2, NRAS, and KRAS) were directly involved in the RAS signaling pathway. The Loh and Maciejewski groups (20â€“22) found that 10â€“15% of JMML patients have mutations in CBL and that these mutations are associated with acquired uniparental disomy. The majority of CBL mutations identified clustered in the linker region and RING finger, both of which play an important role in the E3 ligase activity of CBL. The identification of these JMML-associated CBL mutations raised a number of questions about the role of CBL downstream of GM-CSF receptor, whether CBL is involved in RAS signaling downstream of GM-CSFR, and how mutations in CBL can lead to hypersensitivity to GM-CSF. In order to address these questions, we utilized the TF-1 hematopoietic cell line, which is GM-CSF-responsive (38) and has a low endogenous CBL expression. To examine the functional consequences of CBL linker region mutations, we expressed CBL-Y371H linker and CBL-C384R RING finger mutants, because these are two of the most common CBL mutations observed in JMML patients (21, 22).  We found that expression of these CBL mutants in GM-CSF-stimulated TF-1 cells leads to enhanced and prolonged phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c, which occurred concurrently with elevated expression of both JAK2 and LYN. Assessment of downstream signaling revealed enhanced phosphorylation of S6 in CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing cells relative to wild type CBL controls. TF-1 cells expressing CBL mutations showed enhanced survival in the absence of GM-CSF, and specifically in the case of CBL-Y371H-expressing cells, this is probably due to a decrease in induction of apoptosis. We also observed elevated and constitutive phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants, which was inhibited upon treatment with dasatinib, an SRC family kinase inhibitor. Interestingly, treatment with dasatinib also led to equalization of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation between wild type CBL- and CBL mutant-expressing cells. However, inhibition of JAK2 activity by TG101348 resulted in complete inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation in CBL mutant and wild type CBL control cells.  Expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants results in prolonged and elevated receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, which supports the observed enhancement in survival (67). Martinez-Moczygemba and Huston (37, 68), using the IL-5 receptor as a model for Î²c subunit-sharing cytokine receptors (IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSF), demonstrated that increased Î²c subunit ubiquitination is observed after stimulation. This ubiquitination event leads to the proteasomal degradation of the cytoplasmic tail of the Î²c subunit, which attenuates downstream signaling (37, 68). They also found that the ubiquitination of the Î²c subunit may be mediated by CBL, because the E3 ligase was co-immunoprecipitated with the Î²c subunit. The loss of E3 ligase activity of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants may prevent GM-CSFR Î²c ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the cytoplasmic region of the receptor and culminate in the observed enhancement of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation and elevated levels of JAK2. However, this is unlikely, because we have observed total levels of GM-CSFR Î²c to be lower in CBL mutant cells. Alternatively, increased JAK2 and LYN expression could be correlated with a negative feedback loop that down-regulates GM-CSFR Î²c levels in TF-1 cells. The ubiquitination of Î²c in response to IL-5 stimulation is dependent on JAK2 activity (68, 69). In CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing cells, the enhanced JAK2 activity can potentially lead to increased ubiquitination of the Î²c by other ubiquitin ligases, resulting in decreased overall expression of the receptor subunit.  JAK2 is also regulated via CBL-mediated ubiquitination (23, 70). The expression of CBL mutants Y371H and C384R may result in decreased ubiquitination of JAK2, culminating in elevated levels of JAK2 as well as enhanced JAK2-mediated phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c. We found that in CBL mutant cells, there was elevated expression of JAK2 kinase, which was abolished upon treatment with proteasomal and lysosomal inhibitors.  Similar to JAK2, several members of the SRC family kinases (71), including LYN, have been shown to be ubiquitinated (72) by CBL (73, 74). The enhanced expression of LYN in TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R indicates that, downstream of GM-CSFR, CBL is responsible for LYN ubiquitination. LYN mediates the tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL downstream of Î²1 integrin (61), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (62, 75), and the B-cell antigen receptor (63, 76). We have observed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants, which is abolished upon treatment with the SRC family kinase inhibitor dasatinib. This confirms that LYN is a kinase responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL downstream of the GM-CSFR, and the enhanced phosphorylation of CBL mutants may be a functional consequence of the elevated levels of LYN in CBL mutant-expressing cells.  Phosphorylation of CBL Tyr-731 leads to the activation of the PI3K pathway via recruitment of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (54, 56). The Corey group (62, 77) has shown that LYN couples to the PI3K pathway in a CBL-dependent manner, whereby activated LYN binds and phosphorylates CBL, allowing for the recruitment of p85 to the complex. LYN also activates the PI3K pathway downstream of GM-CSFR Î± (48), promoting cell survival. We have shown that expression of CBL JMML mutants defective in E3 ubiquitin ligase activity leads to aberrant regulation of LYN downstream of GM-CSFR, which ultimately leads to constitutive and enhanced phosphorylation of S6, suggesting elevated PI3K pathway activity. Interestingly, basal activation of S6 has been observed in mononuclear cells isolated from JMML patients (78). Furthermore, in the absence of LYN, the antiapoptotic effects of GM-CSF are abolished (49, 52). At low concentrations of GM-CSF, the signaling pathways activated downstream of the receptor lead to cell survival only, whereas stimulation with higher doses results in cell proliferation and cell survival (79). We have shown that expression of CBL mutants results in enhanced survival, especially at low doses, or in the complete absence of GM-CSF in TF-1 cells. These data suggest that CBL linker and RING finger mutants lower the threshold concentration of GM-CSF required to induce cell survival. Together, these results suggest that in CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing cells, the modulation of the PI3-K pathway due to the increase in LYN levels may be contributing to the observed enhancement of survival in the absence of GM-CSF.  The mechanism by which these mutations lead to elevated GM-CSF signaling and enhanced survival depends on the role of CBL as both an E3 ligase and an adaptor protein. CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants compromise the E3 ligase activity of CBL. We have shown that these loss-of-function mutations lead to increased levels of JAK2 and LYN kinases downstream of the GM-CSFR, potentially due to loss of ubiquitination of the kinases or to the inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c ubiquitination and cytoplasmic domain degradation. These events contribute to the elevated levels of GM-CSF signaling observed in CBL mutant-expressing TF-1 cells. Sanada et al. (23) have shown that Cblâˆ’/âˆ’ LSK cells show a mild cytokine hypersensitivity, but transformation of Cblâˆ’/âˆ’ LSK cells with Cbl linker region mutants significantly enhances the cytokine hypersensitivity, indicating a gain-of-function of the mutants that cannot be ascribed to a simple loss of CBL E3 ligase activity. Inhibition of Cbl-b function by mutant Cbl has been proposed as a possible mechanism (80, 81). However, it is possible that functionality of CBL as an adaptor protein may be contributing to the gain of function of the mutants. Our group, as well as others, has shown that expression of CBL linker and RING finger mutants results in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL (24, 81, 82). This increase in CBL phosphorylation culminates in enhanced PI3K and RAS pathway activation. We found that treatment with dasatinib results in loss of CBL phosphorylation. Interestingly, dasatinib treatment equalized GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation in wild type- and CBL mutant-expressing TF-1 cells. Therefore, dasatinib treatment may decouple the gain-of-function capacity of CBL mutants from the loss of E3 ligase activity. Considering that treatment with JAK2 inhibitor, TG101348, results in complete inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation, dasatinib may provide a treatment option for the enhanced signaling driven by CBL gain-of-function mutations.  Prior studies have shown that expression of CBL linker region and RING finger mutants inhibits stimulation-induced ubiquitination of the EGF-R (23, 29), FLT3, c-KIT, and JAK2 (downstream of EPO-R) (23). Niemeyer et al. (40) have shown that expression of CBL linker region mutants in Ba/F3-EPO-R cells results in an enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, AKT, and S6. In Ba/F3 cells expressing the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase, expression of CBL-Y371 mutants leads to elevated FLT3 phosphorylation as well as AKT and STAT5 (24). Although these studies are useful to probe how CBL mutations perturb FLT3 signaling in AML, no studies have examined the role of CBL JMML mutations in GM-CSF-dependent signaling pathways to date. Our analysis reveals that expression of CBL-Y371H or CBL-C384R in TF-1 cells generates GM-CSF hypersensitivity that affects proximal steps in receptor activation, including GM-CSFR Î²c, JAK2, and LYN coupling to PI3K activation. Unlike with the Ba/F3 results, we failed to observe effects on ERK1/2 or STAT5 activation. Whether this is a function of the unique receptor systems or distinct cell lines remains to be determined.  In conclusion, these studies have confirmed that CBL plays a negative regulatory role downstream of GM-CSFR. We have shown that the enhancement of GM-CSF signaling observed upon loss of CBL E3 ligase activity is due to increased stability of JAK2 and LYN. These results provide in vitro support for further investigation into the applicability of JAK2 and SRC family kinase inhibitors for use in treatment of myeloid malignancies associated with CBL linker region and RING finger mutations. Oncogenic mutations in the monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors, but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study, we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability, binding, and activity. We found that recurrent, homozygous, and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2, by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and, to a lesser extent, with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding, whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity, and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL, driver mutations, protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations), the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability, interactions, and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures, their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2, 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity, stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5, 6). Strikingly, proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinaseâ€“binding domain (TKBD), a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain, while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time, since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain, they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9, 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK, CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein, thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study, substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach, which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability, binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely, we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent, homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.  Go to: Materials and Methods Computational modeling and analysis  Mapping of CBL mutations The COSMIC database (15) stores data on somatic cancer mutations and integrates the experimental data from full-genome sequencing studies. We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations), zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations), types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition, all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a â€œRandomâ€� missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures, we obtained 2,102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL), (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S), (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13), CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%, the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Ã…. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Ã… from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40,000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poissonâ€“Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  Î”Gbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î”Gbindmut-Î”GbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  Î”Î”Gbind=Î±Î”Î”Evdw+Î²Î”Î”Gsolv+Î³Î”SAmut+ÎµÎ”Î”GBM+Î»Î”Î”GFD+Î´ (3) Here Î”Î”Evdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and Î”Î”Gsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. Î”SAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. Î”Î”GBM and Î”Î”GFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX, respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation, optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( Î”Gfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( Î”GfoldWT).  Î”Î”Gfold=Î”Gfoldmut-Î”GfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27), the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). (See Supplementary Methods for more information.)  Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs, described above, were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T, the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega, Madison, WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15, A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15, and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp., Madison, WI), incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change, and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins, cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbeccoâ€™s PBS-containing 200 Î¼M sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals, Fairlawn, NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO], 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors [Complete tabsÂ®, Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16,000 Ã— g for 15 m at 4 Â°C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA). For immunoblotting, 20Î¼g of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue, 0.3573 M Î²-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations, 150 Î¼g of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer, then resuspended in 2X loading buffer, boiled for 5 m, then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman, Sanford, MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins, the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling), rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase, (clone 3F10; Roche), rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc., South Plainfield, NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc., Long Beach, CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination, in the presence of each CBL mutation, was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes, Î”Î”Gfold, upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35, 36). Namely, the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal molâˆ’1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations, recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value â‰ª 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1, Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall, the form of the Î”Î”Gfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the Î”Î”Gfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value â‰ª 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However, it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger, as we show later, this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (Î”Î”Gfold) and binding (Î”Î”Gbind) free energy changes for Single, Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V, G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements, whereas other mutations (S376F, Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example, L405P located in the middle of an Î±-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations, especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters, compared to random mutations (p-value â‰ª 0.01, Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations, therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value â‰ª 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state, consistent with experiments, we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability, recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B, S1 and Table S2). Importantly, cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next, all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations, Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them, several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example, the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal molâˆ’1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10, 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family, it strongly interacts with the Q92, W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q, R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation, there are 49 heterozygous (â€œHeteroâ€�) and 27 homozygous (â€œHomoâ€�) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall, we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 â€“ 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 â€“ 0.003) (Fig. 2B, Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6, 38, 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL, then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele, it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed, human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status, trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples, and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods, Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A, in the presence of wild-type CBL, activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type, CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells, predicted changes in stability (Î”Î”Gfold kcal molâˆ’1), binding affinity (Î”Î”Gbind kcal molâˆ’1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging, attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R, H398Q, Y371H, K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R, H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand, the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This, in turn, could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover, K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B,C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally, the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V, V430M, P428L, Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this, the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific, we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells, transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this, the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells, the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example, the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models, whereas V430M, consistent with experimental data, had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally, the third group constituted mutations (L399V, G375P, P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this, there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly, mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast, the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and Î”Î”Gfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed, the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of Î”Î”Gfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5, changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison, several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy, they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52, with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 (A) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (exponential model) and maximal predicted changes in stability. (B) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (linear model) and predicted changes in binding affinity of pCBL-E2-S state. ... There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations, (30â€“33, 41) and some of them use structural features (31, 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However, all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5, all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEANâ€™s score (R=0.58, Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural, foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand, thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites, which might not be energetically optimal (36, 42). In tumorigenesis, protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level, but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43, 44). However, the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein, here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies, which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation, we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity), while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study, about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity, while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models, we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However, these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed, many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations, but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly, the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene, their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47), where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48, 49). Importantly, all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact, the correlation between Î”Î”Gfold and Î”Î”Gbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 â€“ 0.48 depending on the CBL state, p-value < 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants, one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However, as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes, this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall, our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity, of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases, of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However, there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1), CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand, as shown in our study and in other studies, cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL, so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies, understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed, targeted therapies. Our approach, which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest, emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.  \n",

characterized by hypersensitivity to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). SHP2, NF-1, KRAS, and NRAS are mutated in JMML patients, leading to aberrant regulation of RAS signaling. A subset of JMML patients harbor CBL mutations associated with 11q acquired uniparental disomy. Many of these mutations are in the linker region and the RING finger of CBL, leading to a loss of E3 ligase activity. We investigated the mechanism by which CBL-Y371H, a linker region mutant, and CBL-C384R, a RING finger mutant, lead to enhanced GM-CSF signaling. Expression of CBL mutants in the TF-1 cell line resulted in enhanced survival in the absence of GM-CSF. Cells expressing CBL mutations displayed increased phosphorylation of GM-CSF receptor Î²c subunit in response to stimulation, although expression of total GM-CSFR Î²c was lower. This suggested enhanced kinase activity downstream of GM-CSFR. JAK2 and LYN kinase expression is elevated in CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutant cells, resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of CBL and S6 in response to GM-CSF stimulation. Incubation with the JAK2 inhibitor, TG101348, abolished the increased phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c in cells expressing CBL mutants, whereas treatment with the SRC kinase inhibitor dasatinib resulted in equalization of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation signal between wild type CBL and CBL mutant samples. Dasatinib treatment inhibited the elevated phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants. Our study indicates that CBL linker and RING finger mutants lead to enhanced GM-CSF signaling due to elevated kinase expression, which can be blocked using small molecule inhibitors targeting specific downstream pathways.

In order to mediate its functional activity, GM-CSF binds to its receptor, the GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSFR),2 consisting of GM-CSR Î± and GM-CSFR Î² common (Î²c) subunits. The Î²c subunit of the receptor is shared by the IL-3 and IL-5 receptors. Î²c is the major signaling subunit and is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to cytokine stimulation. Î²c phosphorylation results in the recruitment of various effectors leading to activation of downstream signaling (2â€“4). GM-CSFR Î± is the major binding subunit, which dictates the binding specificity of the receptor complex for GM-CSF (2, 4, 5). The engagement of GM-CSFR by GM-CSF results in the formation of a dodecameric complex of GM-CSFÂ·GM-CSFR Î±Â·GM-CSFR Î²c, which leads to the trans-phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c-associated JAK2 kinases (6). The activated JAK2 kinases phosphorylate GM-CSFR Î²c tyrosine residues, allowing for the recruitment of various effectors and the activation of downstream signaling. GM-CSF stimulation results in the activation of the JAK-STAT, PI3K, and the RAS/MAPK pathways, contributing to GM-CSF-mediated differentiation, proliferation, and survival (reviewed in Refs. 1 and 4).  GM-CSF hypersensitivity is one of the defining characteristics of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). This disease is classified by the World Health Organization as a mixed myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease (7). JMML patients must show persistent monocytosis in the absence of the BCR-ABL oncogene (8). Genetic lesions deregulating the RAS signaling pathway have been identified to lead to JMML pathogenesis. 10â€“15% of JMML patients harbor mutations in neurofibromin protein (NF1) (9, 10), a GTPase-activating protein, which negatively regulates RAS by enhancing the hydrolysis of the active GTP-bound conformation of RAS to the inactive GDP-bound form (11). 35% of JMML patients have mutations in SHP2 (12â€“14), a protein-tyrosine phosphatase that positively regulates the RAS signaling pathway (15, 16). RAS-activating mutations account for another 20â€“25% of JMML-associated mutations (17â€“19). Several groups determined that a proportion of JMML patients have 11q uniparental disomy. CBL mutations were identified upon further analysis of the 11q uniparental disomy samples (20â€“22). The presence of NF1, SHP2, RAS, and CBL mutations are mutually exclusive, raising the question of how CBL mutations can lead to disease development.  CBL mutations have been identified in numerous other myeloid malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic, myeloproliferative, and mixed myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease (23â€“28). The majority of these mutations localize to the CBL linker region or the RING finger. CBL is a ubiquitin E3 ligase, which specifies target proteins for ubiquitination. The linker region and RING finger of CBL play very important roles in its E3 ligase functionality. The linker region contains two conserved tyrosine residues, Tyr-368 and Tyr-371, whose phosphorylation activates and positively regulates E3 ligase activity of CBL (29â€“31). The CBL RING finger is responsible for recruiting active E2s carrying an ubiquitin moiety, allowing for the transfer of ubiquitin to the target substrate (29, 32). Therefore, it is not surprising that mutations in the linker region and RING finger of CBL identified in myeloid malignancies result in a loss of E3 ligase activity.  JMML is associated with GM-CSF hypersensitivity; however, there is a lack of evidence that specifically examines the role of CBL downstream of the GM-CSF receptor and how JMML-associated CBL mutations may affect GM-CSF signaling. CBL is known to become phosphorylated downstream of the Î²c in response to stimulation by IL-3 (33, 34) and GM-CSF (35, 36). Furthermore, CBL associates with the Î²c subunit upon IL-5 stimulation (37). However, these studies do not directly address the role of CBL in GM-CSF signaling.  The objective of this study is to investigate how JMML-associated CBL mutations modulate GM-CSF signaling and lead to GM-CSF hypersensitivity. We expressed wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R in the human TF-1 hematopoietic cell line, which expresses the endogenous GM-CSF receptor at physiological levels (38). Upon GM-CSF stimulation, elevated phosphorylation of GM-CSF Î²c was observed, resulting from elevated JAK2 and LYN phosphorylation. Expression of CBL JMML mutants resulted in enhanced S6 phosphorylation and increased cell survival. Treatment with pharmacologic inhibitors delineated which proximal GM-CSF-dependent pathways are dependent on JAK2 and LYN activation. In summary, our data show that CBL JMML mutants result in enhanced GM-CSF signaling via modulation of JAK2 and LYN tyrosine kinases.  Go to: EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Constructs pMSCV-HA-CBL retroviral vectors were used to create JMML-associated CBL mutants. HA-tagged CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R were constructed using QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kits (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol.  Retrovirus Production HEK 293T cells were plated onto 10-cm dishes (Sarstedt) and grown to around 75% confluence. The 293T cells were transiently transfected with pSV (Gag and Pol proteins) and pVSV-G (envelope protein) and pMSCV-GFP retroviral vectors expressing HA-wild type CBL, HA-CBL-Y371H, or HA-CBL-C384R using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as directed in the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 4.5 Î¼g of pSV, 1.5 Î¼g of VSV-G, and 4.5 Î¼g of pMSCV-IRES-GFP-HA-CBL constructs were mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 in serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM H-21 for 20 min at room temperature. 293T cells were washed with serum-free DMEM H-21, and 4 ml of serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM H-21 was added to the cells. DNA-Lipofectamine 2000 mixture was added to the plated cells and incubated for 6 h at 37 Â°C. Transfection medium was removed from the cells, and 10 ml of RPMI 1640 medium with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum was added. Transfected 293T supernatant containing VSV-G pseudotyped virus carrying pMSCV-HA-CBL was collected at 48 and 72 h post-transfection.  Cell Lines and Culture TF-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 Î¼g of streptomycin/ml, and 2 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF. In order to stably express wild type and mutant CBL, TF-1 cells were infected with VSV-G pseudotyped retrovirus carrying wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R constructs. TF-1 cells were suspended in retroviral supernatant supplemented with 8 ng/ml Polybrene and centrifuged in 50-ml tubes at 12,000 rpm for 75 min. TF-1 cells were resuspended in fresh retroviral Polybrene solution and incubated overnight in 6-well dishes at 37 Â°C. A final round of spinoculation with fresh retroviral supernatant was performed on day 2. TF-1 cells were allowed to expand for 48 h. GFP-positive infected TF-1 cells expressing HA-CBL constructs were purified using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).  XTT Assay TF-1 cells were cytokine-depleted overnight, as described below. 2000 cells were transferred to each well of a 96-well plate in a final volume of 100 Î¼l of RPMI, 10% FCS with the indicated concentrations of GM-CSF. Plates were incubated at 37 Â°C for 48 h prior to the addition of 3 Î¼m phenazine methosulfate (Sigma) and 2 mg/ml XTT (Diagnostic Chemicals). The cells were incubated with the XTT/phenazine methosulfate solution for 6 h at 37 Â°C. The absorption of the reduction product at 450 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer plate reader.  Annexin V Flow Cytometric Analysis TF-1 cells were cytokine-depleted and maintained in cytokine-free media for 72 h. Cells were stained with annexin V-phycoerythrin (PE) according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Pharmingen). Stained cells were analyzed using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer.  Cytokine Deprivation, Stimulation, and Lysis TF-1 cells were washed three times in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), Hanks' balanced salts; depleted in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum overnight at 37 Â°C; and then stimulated with 0.5 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF. Proteasomal and lysosomal degradation was inhibited by incubation of cells with 30 Î¼m MG132 (Calbiochem/Millipore) and 100 Î¼m chloroquine (Sigma), respectively, for 2 h prior to stimulation. JAK2 and LYN kinase activity was inhibited by treatment with 2 m TG101348 (generously provided by Dr. R. Levine) for 4 h or with 0.1 m dasatinib (gift from Dr. D. Hedley) for 2 h, respectively. TF-1 cells were stimulated with 0.5 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF for the indicated times at 37 Â°C.  The cells were washed once in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), Hanks' balanced salts containing 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and supplemented with â€œcOmpleteâ€� protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). After 5 min on ice, the lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 Ã— g for 5 min at 4 Â°C.  Antibodies The 4G10 phosphotyrosine-specific monoclonal antibody and anti-ERK1/2 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology/Millipore. Anti-IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSFR Î²c N-20 (used for immunoblotting) and K-17 (used for immunoprecipitations)), anti-Shp2, and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies specific for phospho-JAK2 (Tyr-1007/1008), JAK2, phospho-SRC family (Tyr-416), phospho-Ser-235/236 S6, and Lynp56 were acquired from Cell Signaling Technologies. An anti-phospho STAT5a/b antibodies were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc./Invitrogen. Anti-STAT5 antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. The monoclonal 12CA5 anti-HA antibody was acquired from Roche Applied Science.  Immunoprecipitations Antibodies along with a 50-Î¼l volume of protein A or protein G-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to 2 mg of lysates for an overnight incubation at 4 Â°C. The beads were washed three times in ice-cold lysis buffer. The immune complexes were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm DTT. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane for Western blotting.  Western Blotting Following the electrophoretic transfer of proteins to PVDF membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), the membranes were blocked at room temperature with 2.5% BSA (w/v) or 5% nonfat dry milk (w/v) in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl) with Tween 20 for 1 h. Membranes were then incubated with an optimal concentration of the primary antibody in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 Â°C. Membranes were washed four times in TBST and incubated with the relevant HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 30â€“60 min. Membranes were washed four times in TBST and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence with autoradiographic film (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). For reprobing, membranes were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 0.1 m Î²-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 Â°C; rinsed twice in TBST; and blocked in 2.5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline prior to primary antibody incubation. Western blots were scanned and quantified using ImageJ software. Quantified Western blots are presented as mean Â± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test.  Go to: RESULTS Enhanced and Prolonged Phosphorylation of the GM-CSFR Î²c in CBL Mutant-expressing Cells GM-CSF hypersensitivity is one of the hallmark features of JMML (39). We utilized the TF-1 hematopoietic cell line to investigate the role of JMML-associated CBL mutations in vitro. TF-1 cells endogenously express the GM-CSF receptor Î± (GM-CSFRÎ±) and the IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSF receptor Î² common chain (GM-CSFR Î²c), and are responsive to GM-CSF. HA-tagged wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R mutants were stably expressed in TF-1 cells (Fig. 1A). All exogenous constructs showed high expression of CBL when compared with vector-infected cells (Fig. 1A). This is especially advantageous because studies have shown that expression of wild type CBL can rescue or mask the effects of CBL mutants (23, 40).  FIGURE 1. FIGURE 1. Enhanced phosphorylation of GM-CSF receptor Î²c upon expression of CBL mutants. A, lysates from parental TF-1 cells as well as from TF-1 cells expressing wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R were probed for CBL expression. IB, immunoblot. B ... Binding of GM-CSF to the GM-CSF receptor complex activates JAK2, leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c. In order to investigate the effects of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants on GM-CSF signaling, we examined the phosphorylation of the GM-CSFR Î²c after stimulation. TF-1 cells expressing wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R were cytokine-depleted and stimulated with GM-CSF. GM-CSFR Î²c was immunoprecipitated from lysates and immunoblotted with the 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Upon GM-CSF stimulation, cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 8 and 9) show enhanced phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c compared with the wild type CBL controls (lanes 2 and 3). Furthermore, prolonged phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c was observed in CBL mutant samples.  CBL plays an important role in stimulation-induced endocytosis, trafficking, and degradation of numerous tyrosine kinase (29, 32) and cytokine receptors (41, 42). To determine whether expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants has an effect on the expression of the GM-CSFR Î²c, as well as its GM-CSF induced degradation, lysates collected from GM-CSF-stimulated TF-1 cells were probed for GM-CSFR Î²c. Because it is likely that CBL-Y371H (23, 30) and CBL-C384R (43) mutations result in a loss of CBL E3 ligase activity, GM-CSFR Î²c levels were expected to be higher in mutant CBL-expressing cells. Surprisingly, expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R (Fig. 2A, lanes 4â€“9) results in a decrease in GM-CSFR Î²c compared with wild type CBL (lanes 1â€“3)-expressing cells at 0, 10, and 60 min (Fig. 2B). However, it is important to note that GM-CSFR Î²c expression decreased after GM-CSF stimulation in wild type and mutant CBL-expressing cells at comparable rates. These results indicate that although expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R results in an overall decreased expression of GM-CSFR Î²c, the degradation of the receptor poststimulation appears not to be disrupted.  FIGURE 2. FIGURE 2. TF-1 cells expressing CBL mutants have lower expression levels of GM-CSFR Î²c. Lysates were collected as described in the legend to Fig. 1. A, immunoblotting (IB) was performed with GM-CSFR Î²c-specific antibody. Blots were reprobed for ... Elevated Levels of JAK2 Kinase in CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing TF-1 Cells Upon binding of GM-CSF to GM-CSFRÎ±, a GM-CSFR Î²c homodimer is recruited (6), bringing the Î²c-associated JAK2 kinase (44, 45) into close proximity, allowing transphosphorylation and subsequent activation of the kinase. Activation of JAK2 is essential for downstream GM-CSF signaling (46, 47). The enhanced and prolonged phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c, along with a decrease in the overall expression of the receptor in CBL mutant-expressing cells may be indicative of elevated kinase activity downstream of GM-CSFR Î²c. Because JAK2 is the main tyrosine kinase downstream of GM-CSFR, the GM-CSF-induced activation of JAK2 was assessed. TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R displayed elevated levels of phosphorylated JAK2 upon GM-CSF stimulation (Fig. 3A, top, lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 8 and 9), compared with the wild type CBL controls (lanes 2 and 3). Reprobing for total JAK2, revealed that the observed enhancement of the phospho-JAK2 signal may be due to an increase in the expression of JAK2 in CBL mutant-expressing cells (Fig. 3, A (middle, lanes 4â€“9) and B).  FIGURE 3. FIGURE 3. Expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants results in elevated JAK2. A, lysates collected from TF-1 cells expressing wild type and CBL mutants were probed for phospho-Tyr-1007/1008 JAK2 and reprobed for total JAK2 and tubulin. B, blots were quantified ... Linker and RING finger mutations disrupt the E3 ligase activity of CBL (29, 31, 32). Such loss of E3 ligase activity has been shown to result in a significant decrease in the EPO-induced ubiquitination of JAK2 (23). In order to determine whether the increase in total JAK2 in CBL mutant expressing cell lines was due to compromised ubiquitination and degradation of the kinase, TF-1 cells expressing wild type CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R were treated with proteasomal (MG-132) and lysosomal (chloroquine) inhibitors prior to stimulation. Inhibition of proteasomal and lysosomal degradation stabilized JAK2 to comparable levels in all three cell lines (Fig. 3C, middle). These results indicate that the expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants affects the degradation of JAK2, leading to elevated levels, which in turn contribute to increased JAK2 phosphorylation and potentially signaling in response to GM-CSF stimulation.  Increased Expression of LYN Kinase in CBL Mutant Cells Although JAK2 is the primary kinase activated downstream of GM-CSF receptor, members of the SRC family kinase are stimulated in response to GM-CSF (48â€“50). Specifically, LYN has been shown to directly associate with GM-CSFR Î²c (51) and to play an important role in mediating the anti-apoptotic effects of GM-CSF in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (49, 52). LYN also associates with GM-CSFRÎ± and is involved in the survival signal required for factor-independent growth of cells expressing the FIÎ” GM-CSFR Î²c mutant (48). Considering that TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R show enhanced survival while exhibiting lower expression of GM-CSFR Î²c, we wanted to determine whether LYN phosphorylation and/or expression was altered in CBL mutant-expressing cells. Lysates collected from GM-CSF-stimulated cells were probed with an antibody specific for pY396-LYN, residing in a phosphorylated motif within the LYN activation loop. Increased LYN phosphorylation was observed in cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants (Fig. 4A, top, lanes 4â€“9), compared with those expressing wild type CBL (lanes 1â€“3). Reprobing for total LYN revealed that CBL mutant cells have increased levels of LYN (p56) (Fig. 4, A (middle, lanes 4â€“9) and B). This observed increase in LYN expression leads to elevated LYN phosphorylation, which may contribute to the enhanced survival of CBL mutant TF-1 cells.  FIGURE 4. FIGURE 4. Increased expression of LYN kinase in CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutant TF-1 cells. A, whole cell lysates collected from TF-1 cells expressing CBL-WT and CBL mutants were immunoblotted with antibodies specific for Tyr(P)-396-LYN. Blots were reprobed for ... Similar to JAK2, treatment with MG-132 and chloroquine stabilized total LYN levels to comparable levels in wild type and mutant cells, indicating that the increase in LYN levels is probably due to the loss of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the CBL mutants (Fig. 4C).  Expression of CBL Mutants Results in Constitutive S6 Phosphorylation and Enhanced Factor-free Survival Investigation of signaling effectors further downstream of the GM-CSF receptor revealed enhanced phosphorylation of SHP2 in CBL mutant-expressing cells relative to wild type CBL controls (Fig. 5A). Constitutive phosphorylation of S6 in TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R, compared with wild type CBL-expressing controls (Fig. 5B), was also observed. No significant differences were observed in the phosphorylation of STAT5 or ERK1/2 (Fig. 5C) between wild type CBL- and mutant CBL-expressing TF-1 cells after GM-CSF stimulation.  FIGURE 5. FIGURE 5. Expression of CBL mutants results in constitutive phosphorylation of S6 and enhanced survival of TF-1 cells. A, SHP2 immunoprecipitations (IP) were performed on lysates collected from TF-1 cells expressing CBL-WT, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R, which were ... XTT assays were performed to determine whether the expression of the CBL linker and RING finger mutants results in enhanced survival and growth. TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants displayed enhanced survival in the absence of GM-CSF relative to cells expressing wild type CBL (Fig. 5D). The increase in the survival of the mutant-expressing cells decreases with increasing concentration of GM-CSF. Cell counting assays were also performed to confirm these results (data not shown). To determine whether the increase in survival was due to a decrease in apoptosis, annexin V staining was performed on cytokine-deprived wild type and mutant CBL-expressing cells. There was a decrease in annexin V-positive TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H relative to wild type CBL-expressing controls, whereas the proportion of annexin V-positive CBL-C384R-expressing cells was comparable with wild type CBL controls (Fig. 5E). These results indicate that JMML-associated CBL mutations result in enhanced survival of TF-1 cells at low doses of GM-CSF.  Constitutive and Enhanced Phosphorylation of CBL Mutants Is Dependent on an SRC Family Kinase CBL is phosphorylated downstream of numerous oncogenic protein-tyrosine kinases (BCR/ABL and v-SRC), receptor tyrosine kinases (PDGF-R, FLT-3, and c-KIT), and cytokine receptors (TPO and EPO) (reviewed in Ref. 53). For example, CBL is tyrosine-phosphorylated downstream of the Î²c chain in response to IL-3 (33, 34) and GM-CSF (35, 36).  The carboxyl-terminal region of CBL contains three major tyrosine phosphorylation sites, Tyr-700, Tyr-731, and Tyr-774 (54). Phosphorylation of these tyrosines leads to the recruitment of SRC homology 2 domain-containing effectors. Phosphorylated Tyr-700 of CBL binds the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, VAV (55). Phosphorylated Tyr-731 acts as the binding site for the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (56, 57), and members of the CRK adaptor protein family have been shown to bind both phosphorylated Tyr-700 and Tyr-774 (58â€“60). Downstream pathways mediated by CBL tyrosine phosphorylation sites play an important role in CBL-mediated signaling. Linker region mutations of CBL have been shown to lead to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL in Ba/F3-FLT3 cells (24).  We were interested in determining whether expression of the linker region Y371H and the RING finger C384R mutations would result in altered CBL tyrosine phosphorylation. CBL was immunoprecipitated from wild type and mutant CBL TF-1 lysates, and phosphorylation was assessed by Tyr(P) immunoblotting (Fig. 6). CBL-Y371H (lanes 4â€“6) and CBL-C384R (lanes 7â€“9) were highly phosphorylated compared with CBL wild type controls (lanes 1â€“3). Both CBL mutants showed constitutive phosphorylation in the absence of GM-CSF stimulation (lanes 4 and 7).  FIGURE 6. FIGURE 6. Dasatinib treatment abolishes the enhanced phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R. TF-1 cells expressing WT and mutant CBL were incubated with dasatinib and TG101348 for 2 and 4 h, respectively, prior to GM-CSF stimulation. Cells were lysed, and HA ... Although numerous members of the SRC family kinases, including LYN (61â€“63), are capable of phosphorylating CBL, there is evidence that Janus kinase family members may also target CBL for tyrosine phosphorylation (64). To determine whether inhibition of JAK2 or SRC family kinases could abolish the enhanced and constitutive phosphorylation of CBL, TF-1 cells expressing wild type and mutant CBL were treated with either the JAK2-specific inhibitor TG101348 or the SRC family kinase inhibitor dasatinib prior to stimulation. The constitutive and enhanced phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants (lanes 22â€“27) persisted in TG101348-treated samples (Fig. 6), whereas pretreatment with dasatinib abolished the elevated phosphorylation of CBL mutants (lanes 13â€“18) to levels comparable with wild type CBL controls (lanes 10â€“12). These results indicate that downstream of the GM-CSF receptor, CBL is phosphorylated by a SRC family kinase, potentially LYN, and mutations in the linker region or the RING finger domain of CBL lead to not only enhanced but also constitutive phosphorylation of CBL.  TG101348-mediated Inhibition of Enhanced Phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c in CBL Mutant-expressing Cells We were interested in determining how the inhibition of JAK2 or SRC family kinases downstream of GM-CSFR would modulate the elevated phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c observed in CBL mutant-expressing cells (Figs. 1B and â€‹and7,7, lanes 1â€“9). TF-1 cells were treated with TG101348 and dasatinib, alone or in combination, prior to stimulation and subsequent GM-CSFR Î²c immunoprecipitation. TG101348 treatment resulted in a significant inhibition of GM-CSF-induced phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c in both wild type CBL- and CBL mutant-expressing cells, resulting in an equally down-modulated level of the phosphorylated receptor (Fig. 7, lanes 10â€“18). This was expected, because JAK2 is known to be the kinase responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of the GM-CSFR Î²c in response to stimulation (47, 65, 66).  FIGURE 7. FIGURE 7. Inhibition of JAK2 activity via treatment with TG101348 abolishes the enhanced phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î² in CBL mutant-expressing cells. TF-1 cells expressing WT-CBL, CBL-Y371H, and CBL-C384R were cytokine-depleted and treated with 2 mm TG101348 ... Interestingly, inhibition of SRC family kinases did not result in the inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation, but it did result in an equivalent level of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation in wild type CBL and CBL mutant samples (Fig. 7, lanes 19â€“27). Treatment with both TG101348 and dasatinib inhibited GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation (Fig. 7, lanes 28â€“36) to similar levels observed in samples treated with only TG101348.  Go to: DISCUSSION Hypersensitivity to GM-CSF is one of the defining characteristics of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Until recently, genes mutated in JMML patients (NF1, SHP2, NRAS, and KRAS) were directly involved in the RAS signaling pathway. The Loh and Maciejewski groups (20â€“22) found that 10â€“15% of JMML patients have mutations in CBL and that these mutations are associated with acquired uniparental disomy. The majority of CBL mutations identified clustered in the linker region and RING finger, both of which play an important role in the E3 ligase activity of CBL. The identification of these JMML-associated CBL mutations raised a number of questions about the role of CBL downstream of GM-CSF receptor, whether CBL is involved in RAS signaling downstream of GM-CSFR, and how mutations in CBL can lead to hypersensitivity to GM-CSF. In order to address these questions, we utilized the TF-1 hematopoietic cell line, which is GM-CSF-responsive (38) and has a low endogenous CBL expression. To examine the functional consequences of CBL linker region mutations, we expressed CBL-Y371H linker and CBL-C384R RING finger mutants, because these are two of the most common CBL mutations observed in JMML patients (21, 22).  We found that expression of these CBL mutants in GM-CSF-stimulated TF-1 cells leads to enhanced and prolonged phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c, which occurred concurrently with elevated expression of both JAK2 and LYN. Assessment of downstream signaling revealed enhanced phosphorylation of S6 in CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing cells relative to wild type CBL controls. TF-1 cells expressing CBL mutations showed enhanced survival in the absence of GM-CSF, and specifically in the case of CBL-Y371H-expressing cells, this is probably due to a decrease in induction of apoptosis. We also observed elevated and constitutive phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants, which was inhibited upon treatment with dasatinib, an SRC family kinase inhibitor. Interestingly, treatment with dasatinib also led to equalization of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation between wild type CBL- and CBL mutant-expressing cells. However, inhibition of JAK2 activity by TG101348 resulted in complete inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation in CBL mutant and wild type CBL control cells.  Expression of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants results in prolonged and elevated receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, which supports the observed enhancement in survival (67). Martinez-Moczygemba and Huston (37, 68), using the IL-5 receptor as a model for Î²c subunit-sharing cytokine receptors (IL-3/IL-5/GM-CSF), demonstrated that increased Î²c subunit ubiquitination is observed after stimulation. This ubiquitination event leads to the proteasomal degradation of the cytoplasmic tail of the Î²c subunit, which attenuates downstream signaling (37, 68). They also found that the ubiquitination of the Î²c subunit may be mediated by CBL, because the E3 ligase was co-immunoprecipitated with the Î²c subunit. The loss of E3 ligase activity of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants may prevent GM-CSFR Î²c ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the cytoplasmic region of the receptor and culminate in the observed enhancement of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation and elevated levels of JAK2. However, this is unlikely, because we have observed total levels of GM-CSFR Î²c to be lower in CBL mutant cells. Alternatively, increased JAK2 and LYN expression could be correlated with a negative feedback loop that down-regulates GM-CSFR Î²c levels in TF-1 cells. The ubiquitination of Î²c in response to IL-5 stimulation is dependent on JAK2 activity (68, 69). In CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing cells, the enhanced JAK2 activity can potentially lead to increased ubiquitination of the Î²c by other ubiquitin ligases, resulting in decreased overall expression of the receptor subunit.  JAK2 is also regulated via CBL-mediated ubiquitination (23, 70). The expression of CBL mutants Y371H and C384R may result in decreased ubiquitination of JAK2, culminating in elevated levels of JAK2 as well as enhanced JAK2-mediated phosphorylation of GM-CSFR Î²c. We found that in CBL mutant cells, there was elevated expression of JAK2 kinase, which was abolished upon treatment with proteasomal and lysosomal inhibitors.  Similar to JAK2, several members of the SRC family kinases (71), including LYN, have been shown to be ubiquitinated (72) by CBL (73, 74). The enhanced expression of LYN in TF-1 cells expressing CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R indicates that, downstream of GM-CSFR, CBL is responsible for LYN ubiquitination. LYN mediates the tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL downstream of Î²1 integrin (61), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (62, 75), and the B-cell antigen receptor (63, 76). We have observed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants, which is abolished upon treatment with the SRC family kinase inhibitor dasatinib. This confirms that LYN is a kinase responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL downstream of the GM-CSFR, and the enhanced phosphorylation of CBL mutants may be a functional consequence of the elevated levels of LYN in CBL mutant-expressing cells.  Phosphorylation of CBL Tyr-731 leads to the activation of the PI3K pathway via recruitment of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (54, 56). The Corey group (62, 77) has shown that LYN couples to the PI3K pathway in a CBL-dependent manner, whereby activated LYN binds and phosphorylates CBL, allowing for the recruitment of p85 to the complex. LYN also activates the PI3K pathway downstream of GM-CSFR Î± (48), promoting cell survival. We have shown that expression of CBL JMML mutants defective in E3 ubiquitin ligase activity leads to aberrant regulation of LYN downstream of GM-CSFR, which ultimately leads to constitutive and enhanced phosphorylation of S6, suggesting elevated PI3K pathway activity. Interestingly, basal activation of S6 has been observed in mononuclear cells isolated from JMML patients (78). Furthermore, in the absence of LYN, the antiapoptotic effects of GM-CSF are abolished (49, 52). At low concentrations of GM-CSF, the signaling pathways activated downstream of the receptor lead to cell survival only, whereas stimulation with higher doses results in cell proliferation and cell survival (79). We have shown that expression of CBL mutants results in enhanced survival, especially at low doses, or in the complete absence of GM-CSF in TF-1 cells. These data suggest that CBL linker and RING finger mutants lower the threshold concentration of GM-CSF required to induce cell survival. Together, these results suggest that in CBL-Y371H- and CBL-C384R-expressing cells, the modulation of the PI3-K pathway due to the increase in LYN levels may be contributing to the observed enhancement of survival in the absence of GM-CSF.  The mechanism by which these mutations lead to elevated GM-CSF signaling and enhanced survival depends on the role of CBL as both an E3 ligase and an adaptor protein. CBL-Y371H and CBL-C384R mutants compromise the E3 ligase activity of CBL. We have shown that these loss-of-function mutations lead to increased levels of JAK2 and LYN kinases downstream of the GM-CSFR, potentially due to loss of ubiquitination of the kinases or to the inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c ubiquitination and cytoplasmic domain degradation. These events contribute to the elevated levels of GM-CSF signaling observed in CBL mutant-expressing TF-1 cells. Sanada et al. (23) have shown that Cblâˆ’/âˆ’ LSK cells show a mild cytokine hypersensitivity, but transformation of Cblâˆ’/âˆ’ LSK cells with Cbl linker region mutants significantly enhances the cytokine hypersensitivity, indicating a gain-of-function of the mutants that cannot be ascribed to a simple loss of CBL E3 ligase activity. Inhibition of Cbl-b function by mutant Cbl has been proposed as a possible mechanism (80, 81). However, it is possible that functionality of CBL as an adaptor protein may be contributing to the gain of function of the mutants. Our group, as well as others, has shown that expression of CBL linker and RING finger mutants results in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL (24, 81, 82). This increase in CBL phosphorylation culminates in enhanced PI3K and RAS pathway activation. We found that treatment with dasatinib results in loss of CBL phosphorylation. Interestingly, dasatinib treatment equalized GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation in wild type- and CBL mutant-expressing TF-1 cells. Therefore, dasatinib treatment may decouple the gain-of-function capacity of CBL mutants from the loss of E3 ligase activity. Considering that treatment with JAK2 inhibitor, TG101348, results in complete inhibition of GM-CSFR Î²c phosphorylation, dasatinib may provide a treatment option for the enhanced signaling driven by CBL gain-of-function mutations.  Prior studies have shown that expression of CBL linker region and RING finger mutants inhibits stimulation-induced ubiquitination of the EGF-R (23, 29), FLT3, c-KIT, and JAK2 (downstream of EPO-R) (23). Niemeyer et al. (40) have shown that expression of CBL linker region mutants in Ba/F3-EPO-R cells results in an enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, AKT, and S6. In Ba/F3 cells expressing the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase, expression of CBL-Y371 mutants leads to elevated FLT3 phosphorylation as well as AKT and STAT5 (24). Although these studies are useful to probe how CBL mutations perturb FLT3 signaling in AML, no studies have examined the role of CBL JMML mutations in GM-CSF-dependent signaling pathways to date. Our analysis reveals that expression of CBL-Y371H or CBL-C384R in TF-1 cells generates GM-CSF hypersensitivity that affects proximal steps in receptor activation, including GM-CSFR Î²c, JAK2, and LYN coupling to PI3K activation. Unlike with the Ba/F3 results, we failed to observe effects on ERK1/2 or STAT5 activation. Whether this is a function of the unique receptor systems or distinct cell lines remains to be determined.  In conclusion, these studies have confirmed that CBL plays a negative regulatory role downstream of GM-CSFR. We have shown that the enhancement of GM-CSF signaling observed upon loss of CBL E3 ligase activity is due to increased stability of JAK2 and LYN. These results provide in vitro support for further investigation into the applicability of JAK2 and SRC family kinase inhibitors for use in treatment of myeloid malignancies associated with CBL linker region and RING finger mutations.
